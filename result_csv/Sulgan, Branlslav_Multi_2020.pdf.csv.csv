4,4,"Abstract: This paper provides a multi-aspect comparison of selected methods of ethyl acetate
production and shows the possibility of further reactive distillation process integration and
sophisticated intensiﬁcation including process stream regeneration. The production pathways
were selected with respect to their practical applicability and suﬃcient experimental and feasibility
studies already published. A total of four case studies were designed and compared: conventional
process set-up (ethyl acetate is produced in a chemical reactor) is designed as a base case study; reactive
distillation with a separation unit is derived from the conventional process set-up. The mechanical
and chemical approach to reactive distillation process intensiﬁcation and integration were assumed:
reactive distillation column with a stripper and reactive distillation column with an auxiliary chemical
reaction (ethylene oxide hydration). Process models were compiled in the Aspen Plus software.
Complex process ﬂowsheets of selected case studies including separation and regeneration were
designed and optimized. Three diﬀerent points of view were applied to evaluate the selected process
beneﬁts and drawbacks. Process energy, economy, and safety were assessed. As a result, a reactive
distillation column with an auxiliary chemical reaction has been proven to be the most suitable
pathway for ethyl acetate production assuming all three evaluated aspects.",0,process

7,7,Ethyl acetate is known as one of the key organic solvents.,0,process
8,8,"It is widely used in various
industries mainly due to its reasonable price, low toxicity, and suitable properties as a solvent [1].
Global consumption of ethyl acetate has been steadily increasing over the last decades [2]. At present,
the world’s annual production capacity is estimated at 3 million tons, which increases due to the
growing consumption of ethyl acetate expected in the following years. Therefore, it is necessary to
intensify existing ethyl acetate production and to design new plants employing more eﬃcient processes
compared to the conventionally used ones.",0,process
9,9,"The use of direct Fischer esteriﬁcation is still the most commonly used method to produce
ethyl acetate. Ethanol and acetic acid are used as reactants in the presence of an acidic catalyst.
Other chemical paths for ethyl acetate production implemented on an industrial scale are based
on ethylene acetylation or ethanol dehydrogenation respectively. However, these paths have been
denoted as non-economic and even potentially dangerous [3]. Therefore, esteriﬁcation is still preferred,",0,process

14,14,"especially due to the possibility of using diﬀerent catalysts, the availability of raw materials from
renewable sources, and the potential for process intensiﬁcation [4]. At present, much attention is given
to overcoming the limitations associated with the equilibrium esteriﬁcation reaction; in particular,
separation of azeotropic mixtures formed during the production process, distillation boundaries,
by-product removal, energy consumption reduction, and improvement of process economy [5–7].",0,process
15,15,"Several techniques are used to solve the separation of azeotropic mixtures containing water,
ethyl acetate, and ethanol, for example, azeotropic distillation, pressure swing distillation, and extractive
distillation. All these techniques are well known and the latest knowledge in this ﬁeld including
heat integration [8], thermal coupling [9], dividing wall columns [10], pervaporation modules [11,12],
use of a new class of solvents (ionic liquids) [13,14] can be applied eﬀectively. Although the separation
of azeotropic mixtures is possible, high energy consumption and a high number of devices should
be expected.",0,process
16,16,"To overcome distillation boundaries and reduce energy demands and the number of equipment
units, reactive distillation (RD) can be used [6]. The concept of RD combining simultaneous chemical
reaction and separation in one unit has shown great potential in the production of esters [15,16].
Industrial-scale plants combining a reactive distillation column with a separation unit can be found all
over the world [16,17]. However, even though RD itself has brought beneﬁts compared to conventional
production processes, it still shows potential for intensiﬁcation. Taking RD to the next level of
process intensiﬁcation requires more advanced RD conﬁgurations allowing an additional range of
operating conditions (not available in classic RD setups) [16]. Improvements can be achieved by
physical, chemical, or mechanical methods [4,18]. Physical methods are based on improving the
separation of reactive distillation products by adding a selective solvent (azeotropic reactive distillation
(ARD), reactive extractive distillation (RED)), or by changing operation conditions (pressure-swing
RD). The production of 2-phenylethyl acetate via azeotropic reactive distillation can be listed as
an illustrative example [19]. Employing an auxiliary chemical reaction in the RD system is used as the
chemical path of intensiﬁcation. One by-product of the main reaction is consumed by the auxiliary
reaction; another valuable product can be obtained. Reactive distillation with an auxiliary reaction
(RDAR) is a very innovative method that can improve the main reaction and separation at the same
time [4,20]. Mechanical ways of RD intensiﬁcation are focused on the use of special internal equipment
of columns to ease the separation (reactive distillation with a dividing wall (RDWC) and reactive
distillation with pervaporation (RDPV)); which intensify the chemical reaction (special catalyst beds in
case of a heterogeneous catalyst) [4]. Special attention is given to integrated columns with strippers
(RDS), recompression of superheated vapor, etc. [18,21].",0,process
17,17,1.1. Current Ethyl Acetate Production Methods,0,process
18,18,"Usually, the esteriﬁcation reaction of acetic acid by ethanol is used to form ethyl acetate. The process
composed of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and several separation columns is reported
as the most widespread ethyl acetate commercial production method [15]. At least three distillation
columns are needed to separate the reaction mixture from the CSTR. First, unreacted acetic acid has
to be regenerated—this separation is a high energy-consuming [4,15] and azeotropic distillation is
recommended to reduce energy consumption in the ﬁrst column [17]. One of the process products
(ethyl acetate) is used as an azeotropic agent. A decanter has to be deployed to overcome the distillation
boundary and thus allow separation of pure ethyl acetate in a second distillation column. The third
column is usually used for water regeneration. Despite several options for columns and recycles
integration, this process is energy-intensive [5]. Moreover, large recycles are used due to the distillation
boundary and the equipment has also to be relatively large. Reactive distillation is used as the
second method for ethyl acetate industrial production [16]. RD column, decanter, and two distillation
columns are employed. A water-ethanol-ethyl acetate azeotropic mixture is obtained in the RD column
and it is then separated in a similar way as in the conventional method. However, many other RD
conﬁgurations have been tested at a laboratory scale, including all three of the above-mentioned",0,process

21,21,"ways of improvement and intensiﬁcation [4]. The research has been mainly focused on RDWC [22];
RDAR [23,24]; RDS [4,18], and RED [25]. However, so far, only a classic RD column with a separation
unit is used at the industrial scale. This is mainly due to the simplicity of design and control of this
approach compared to integrated RD conﬁgurations [15,16]. However, with the advancement of
process regulation and production design, it is clear that many production lines will be transformed
into fully integrated RD processes [16,22] in the future.",0,process

23,23,"The main goal of this paper is the comparison of selected ethyl acetate production pathways
and to point out the possibility of further reactive distillation process integration and sophisticated
intensiﬁcation including process stream regeneration. Three diﬀerent points of view were applied
to evaluate the selected process’s pros and cons. Process energy, economy, and safety are assessed.
Comprehensive research has been accomplished to select case studies demonstrating more levels of
process integration and intensiﬁcation [4,16]. The production pathways have been selected with respect
to their practical applicability (both present and future), to suﬃcient experimental and feasibility studies
already published, and the intensiﬁcation of reactive distillation via chemical and mechanical methods.
As the base case study, a conventional process from [15,17] was adopted. Operation sequence according
to Riemenschneider [1] consists of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and several separation
columns. A classic reactive distillation process design was used as the second case study because of its
present practical industrial applicability [4]. Mechanical modiﬁcation of RD is represented by the third
case study where an RD column with a stripper (RDS) is used. The RDS process set-up is well known
in the petrochemical industry. In the fourth case study, an auxiliary chemical reaction is included
as a chemical modiﬁcation of RD. Hydration of ethylene oxide is proposed as the auxiliary reaction.
With this intensiﬁcation method, ethyl acetate–water azeotrope is removed and pure ethyl acetate is
separated at the top of the RD column [23]. In addition, another valuable product (monoethylene
glycol) is obtained when the auxiliary reaction is included.",0,process
24,24,"Process modeling was performed using the Aspen Plus software [26]. Reliable and complex
models were compiled to evaluate and compare individual case studies. An important beneﬁt of this
work is the detailed design of all case studies including the rigorous non-equilibrium stage (NEQ)
model of reactive distillation and separation columns. More accurate results are expected when using
the NEQ model contrary to works where only the equilibrium stage model (EQ) is used [18–20]. Muthia
(2018) has proved that the reactive distillation EQ model is useful in the process feasibility analysis [27].
However, RD partial processes can be overestimated by this model; namely separation eﬃciency and
chemical reaction rate. In the EQ model, the separation eﬃciency has to be estimated and thus it can
be overestimated as well as underestimated.",0,process
25,25,"The chemical reaction rate is inﬂuenced by mass transfer; therefore it can be signiﬁcantly
overestimated [16,22]. Consequently, the equipment size is estimated incorrectly, and the energy
consumption is often underestimated [28,29]. Therefore, the NEQ model should be preferred when
assessing the economy and safety aspects [30,31].",0,process
26,26,"Processes with uneven yield and poor recovery design have been compared previously [15,32].
Conclusions from these results have been confused because of incomplete process material balance
and comparison of incomplete design of process schemes. Therefore, recycling of process streams
and uniﬁcation of case studies inlet and outlet streams have been included in this paper. With this
improvement, reproducible comparison of individual case studies is achieved; ethyl acetate yield and
water recovery problems are solved.",0,process

utility cost, and raw materials cost [33]. Product sales are dependent on the actual market situation
and therefore the price can be quite volatile. Consequently, the long-term average has to be considered.

relatively easy to understand and use. The form of the presentation varies depending on the goal of the

other alternatives, the presentation of individual risk as a function of distance (individual risk proﬁles)

acetate (EtAc), ethanol (EtOH), water (H2O), and acetic acid (AA); one case study is extended by ethylene
oxide (EO) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). This system is strongly non-ideal. Two homogeneous
binary azeotropes (EtOH–H2O, EtOH–EtAc), one heterogeneous binary azeotrope (EtAc–H2O),

Monoethylene glycol does not form an azeotropic mixture with other mentioned components.
Unlike other components, ethylene oxide is a gas at room temperature [38]. For such a system,
the NRTL-HOC thermodynamic model is highly recommended [15,22,28] as it is capable of calculating
the VLLE (vapor–liquid–liquid phase equilibria) correctly including two liquid phases, azeotropic
mixtures composition, and boing points, dimerization in the vapor phase. All the above-mentioned

63,63,"Mechanism and reaction kinetics of the esteriﬁcation reaction of ethanol and acetic acid in the
presence of acid catalysts has been studied in many works [1,39,40]. Three types of catalysis have
been reported: autocatalysis, homogeneous catalysis, and heterogeneous catalysis. The reaction rate
is low and achievable conversion is up to 20% at high residence times in the case of autocatalysis
reaction [39]. Strong mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, are traditionally used
as homogeneous catalysts [15]. High conversion, of up to 65.5%, is achieved in industrial applications
using sulfuric acid [1] in the range from 0.2 to 1.0 volume percent of the reactive mixture [15,23].
Acidic ion exchange resins in various forms have been used as heterogeneous catalysts to increase
conversion (slightly below 70%); however, no solid heterogeneous catalyst has been found to increase
the reaction rate in favor of ethyl acetate production better than sulfuric acid [15]. High reaction rate,
high conversion, and a smaller amount of catalyst are preferred from the industrial point of view.
In addition, process set-up and equipment design are much easier in the case of homogeneous catalysis.
On the other hand, equipment corrosion and catalyst recycling are major drawbacks of homogeneous

115,115,"The CSTR (Figure 1) reactor is designed as an adiabatic one with a residence time of 200 min [15].
The esteriﬁcation reaction is described by reaction kinetics, Equation (6). Lower acetic acid conversion
is achieved compared to that reported in the literature (53.0% compared to 63.0%). This is caused by the
connection of recycled streams (D32, W12) in which, in addition to EtAc, water is present. Therefore,
conversion in the CSTR reactor is slightly shifted towards the reactants side. The volume of the liquid
phase in CSTR is calculated to be 8.9 m3.",1,process
116,116,"Separation of unreacted acetic acid is the primary function of the C1 column (Figure 1) employing
azeotropic distillation to make this process easier and less energy-intensive. No azeotropic agent
selection was done as a suitable agent (EtAc) is produced in the process directly. The ratio of recirculated
(AZ) and produced EtAc (W22) is set to 1. Such an amount of recirculated EtAc is suﬃcient to ensure
desired C1 column speciﬁcations at reasonable energy demands. If the ratio is below 0.8, azeotropic
distillation does not run. As EtAc forms a ternary azeotrope with water and ethanol at the lowest boiling
temperature in the system, separation of AA in the bottom product (W11) is possible. Total recovery of
AA in the bottom product (W11) is required (less than 0.001 mol.% of AA is allowed in the distillate
(D11)). The desired purity of AA (W11) was set to 70 mol.% based on recycle ﬂow (W11) and energy
consumption optimization. Consequently, the C1 column reboiler temperature was below 100
C.
Also, column hydraulics is an issue due to diﬀerent liquid ﬂows in the rectifying and stripping
section, which is caused by two feed streams and process intensiﬁcation via azeotropic distillation.
Therefore, two packing diameters (25 mm and 35 mm) are used within one column diameter (1.0 m).

118,118,"The next important separation step takes place in the decanter. Water to ethyl acetate mole ﬂow
ratio in the stream (D13) is a crucial parameter of the decanter in overcoming the distillation boundary
and thus allowing separation of pure EtAc. The ratio was set to 4.1 and therefore the EtAc concentration
increased from 56.6 mol.% (D11) to 76.7 mol.% (ORG), Table 1. EtAc recovery in the decanter of over
90% was achieved, which is common in the separation of two liquid phases [5,22].",1,process
119,119,"Distillation column C2 (Figure 1) is designed for pure EtAc (99.9 mol.%) separation, which is
a highly energy consuming process as EtAc–EtOH–water ternary azeotrope is formed in the distillate
−1 of pure EtAc in the

−1 of organic phase ﬂow (ORG) from the decanter is
C2 bottom product (W21), more than 41 kmol h
needed and thus only 63.2% EtAc recovery can be achieved in the C2 column due to the distillation
boundary and the azeotrope composition. A high reﬂux ratio is also required because the ternary
azeotrope and pure ethyl acetate boiling point temperature are close. Designed C2 column parameters

reaction and separation together via the reactive distillation process. Several RD plants for ethyl
acetate production are operated worldwide with the reported individual plant annual production
capacity of around 20,000 tons of EtAc [4,15]. As RD is a multifunctional reactor concept combining the
mechanism of reaction and separation in one single unit, beneﬁts such as the reduction of equipment
and plant size, improvement of process eﬃciency, and, consequently, better process economy are
expected [19]. In this case study, the main beneﬁt expected is the reduction of the number of equipment
units and overcoming the distillation boundary which limits the conventional set-up. CSTR, EX1,
and C1 columns are put together into an RD column. As a result, one main equipment unit (CSTR) and

293,293,"in Figure 1). A detailed process scheme is depicted in Figure 2. The reactive distillation column has
two feed streams: acetic acid feed (AA0) and mixed ethanol feed (ETOH). Raw ethanol is added to the
process in the (ETOH0) stream. All acetic acid is consumed in the RD. Therefore, RD distillate (D11)
contains a nearly azeotropic mixture of EtAc-EtOH-water, while the bottom product (W11) contains
a water-ethanol mixture (Figure 2). The distillate composition was from a diﬀerent distillation region
than that of distillate in the conventional process set-up (D11 in Figure 1). Therefore, stream (D11 in
Figure 2) can be separated directly. Distillation column C1 is deployed to separate the ﬁnal pure EtAc
(Figure 2). The C1 column bottom product (W21) contains pure EtAc which is cooled down in heat
exchanger EX5. The EtAc-EtOH-water ternary azeotrope is present in the C1 column distillate (D21 in
Figure 2) Thus, columns C1 column (Figure 2) and C2 in conventional process set-up (Figure 1) are
operated in the same way. The distillate (D21) is cooled down in heat exchangers EX1 and EX2 and
fed into decanter DEC to extract EtAc (Figure 2). Pure water is fed to DEC; organic phase (ORG1)
and aqueous phase (H2OL) are separated. The organic phase (ORG1) is preheated in EX1 and mixed
with (D11). The aqueous phase (H2OL) contains some amount of EtOH and EtAc and therefore it
has to be regenerated. The (H2OL) stream is mixed with the RD column bottom product (W11) and
preheated in heat exchanger EX3 (Figure 2). For water regeneration, distillation column C2 is used
(Figure 2). All EtOH and EtAc are obtained in the C2 distillate (D31) which is recirculated back to the
RD column. Pure water is separated in the C2 bottom product (W31) and it is cooled down in EX3
and EX4 (Figure 2). An equimolar ratio of water to EtAc product (W22) is separated (H2OP) as a ﬁnal
by-product and the rest of the water is recirculated back to the decanter (H2OREC).",1,process

295,295,"The reactive distillation column was designed according to the philosophy described in Sections 2.3
and 2.4. However, column operating conditions are diﬀerent. As the esteriﬁcation reaction (5) proceeds,
reactants conversion (acetic acid, ethanol) has to be considered. From an energetic point of view,
consumption of all acetic acid is the most advantageous as no acetic acid is present in the distillate or the
−5,
bottom product of the RD column (Figure 2). To achieve total acetic acid conversion (xD11(AA) = 10
−5), the RD column parameters were optimized including: acetic acid feed (f AA) and
xW11(AA) = 10
ethanol feed (f EtOH) position; reﬂux ratio (R); number of theoretical stages (N). The reactive zone (NR)
is introduced from f AA to a reboiler. However, if the NEQ model is used to simulate the RD column,
the packing height (H), column internal diameter (d) as well as the packing type are crucial parameters.
Moreover, RD column hydraulics is limited by the reﬂux ratio with regard to design speciﬁcations.
At reﬂux ratios below 2, AA is present in the distillate; on the other hand, at reﬂux ratios above 3.5,
a part of the column is ﬂooded and total AA conversion cannot be achieved. Final RD column design
parameters after the optimization are listed in Table 4.",1,process
296,296,"Separation of pure EtAc is performed in distillation column C1 (Figure 2) designed in the same
way as the C2 column in the conventional set-up (C2 in Figure 1). The ethyl acetate purity of 99.9 mol.%
in the bottom product (W21) is set as the design criterion. Designed column (C1 in Figure 2) parameters
are listed in Table 4. Overheated vapors from the C1 column contain almost 54 mol.% of EtAc (Table 3)
which is extracted in decanter DEC (Figure 2). The same amount of water is added to DEC as in the
conventional process (Figure 1). The separated organic phase (ORG1) contains 75.5 mol.% of EtAc and
the overall EtAc yield in DEC is 90%.",1,process

the distillate (D31). The optimum ethanol content in the distillate is determined to be 62 mol.%.

441,441,"Even though the RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2) represents process integration and
intensiﬁcation compared to the conventional set-up (Figure 1), there is still a place for improvement such
as the reduction of the large ﬂow of the recycled stream to the decanter or reduction of equipment number.
As the reaction in the RD process has overcome the distillation boundary, it is possible to remove the
decanter and to solve azeotropic mixture regeneration via distillation. Also, the ethanol-water mixture
from the RD column (W11 in Figure 2) can be easily separated into pure water (high boiling point) and
ethanol-water mixture at high ethanol concentrations. Therefore, the ﬂowsheet of the RD column with
a separation unit (Figure 2) was modiﬁed: C2 column is integrated into the bottom part of the RD
column; decanter and heat exchangers EX1 and EX2 are removed; C1 column condenser is removed
and overheated vapors from C1 are recirculated back to the RD column (Figure 3). Thus, the process
scheme in Figure 3 contains two columns and three heat exchangers less than the process scheme
shown in Figure 2.",1,process
442,442,"The main idea of such integration is based on the thermal coupling. Two columns are thermally
coupled if a vapor (liquid) stream is sent from the ﬁrst column to the second one and then a return
liquid (vapor) stream is set between the same columns. These streams, when introduced at the top or
bottom of a column, provide (at least partial) reﬂux or boil-up to this column [42]. This approach is
commonly used in the petrochemical industry [43,44].",1,process

acetic acid and is led to the upper section of the RD column; (ETOH0) contains pure ethanol and is
attached to the bottom section of the RD column; and overheated vapors (AZ1) from stripper C1 fed in
the middle of the RD column (Figure 3). The RD column has two product streams: liquid distillate
(D1) brought to the head of stripper C1; liquid bottom product (W11) which is cooled down in heat
exchanger EX1. The stripper column has only one product stream (W21), which is cooled down in heat
exchanger EX2.",1,process
450,450,3.3.2. Process Simulation and Equipment Parameters of Reactive Distillation Column with a Stripper,1,process
451,451,"The main task in designing an RD column with a stripper (RDS in Figure 3) is to ensure total
conversion of acetic acid in the RD column. Thus, no acetic acid should be present in the distillate or
bottom product, the same as in the RD column with a separation unit concept (Figure 2). To meet this
requirement, a high number of theoretical stages, suitable position of feed stages, proper RD column
reﬂux ratio, and amount of recirculated vapors have to be considered. In contrast to the RD column
with a separation unit (Figure 2), in the case of an RD column with a stripper (Figure 3), three feed
streams are attached: two subcooled liquid streams and one overheated vapor stream (AZ1 in Figure 3).
Composition of the (AZ1) stream is expected to be close to the azeotropic mixture EtAc-EtOH-water)
and therefore is the (AZ1) stream feed stage (f AZ1) located in the middle part of the main RD column,
between the acetic acid feed stage (f AA0) and the ethanol feed stage (f EtOH0). Acetic acid conversion is
signiﬁcantly aﬀected by a change of f AZ1. If f AZ1 is attached above f AA0, the RD column does not work
at all as the high amount of ethanol in (AZ1) stream cannot be consumed in the reaction (5). On the
other hand, if f AZ0 is attached below f EtOH0, the esteriﬁcation reaction (5) is slowed down because
of an excess of its products (EtAc and water) in the stripping section of the RD column. The reﬂux
−5); however, it is also signiﬁcantly
ratio is calculated based on the design speciﬁcation (xD1(AA) = 10
inﬂuenced by stripper C1. Intense recirculation of overheated vapors leads to partial boil-up in the RD
column while the RD column distillate (D1 in Figure 3) leads to liquid reﬂux of stripper C1. The vapors
ﬂow (˙nAZ1 in Table 5) is the key process parameter along with the feed stage position (f AZ1). At least
−1 of overheated vapor are needed to operate the process successfully. At lower vapor

ﬂow, desired product purity (xW11(H2O) = 0.999 and xW21(EtAc) = 0.999) cannot be achieved either in
−1,
the RD column or in the C1 striper. A slightly higher amount of recirculated vapors (135.5 kmol h
see Table 5) is used to ensure process stability and reasonable column hydraulics.",1,process

increasing concentration of products. Therefore, the removal of water as a by-product is attempted to

EO (gas) diﬀusion to the liquid phase is the process rate limiting factor. The diﬀusion rate is inﬂuenced
by several aspects; however, the key one is the column hydraulics. If the EO feed stage is attached to

of heat exchangers including heat integration. Overall energy consumption (OEC) is calculated as
a sum of required heating or cooling duties respectively; heat integration is excluded. To better compare
individual case studies, OEC is normalized to the speciﬁc energy consumption (SEC, Equation (1)),
which is related to the production of one ton of pure EtAc. Summary results of energy requirements
are listed in Table 9.",0,process
614,614,"The conventional process set-up (Figure 1) has three distillation columns in which both reboiler
and condenser are included. Thus, a highly energy-intensive process is expected. Distillation column
for water regeneration C3 consumes almost 550 kW of heat, which represents 18.4% of the total heat
duty required in whole the conventional path (Figure 1). However, the column for separation of
unreacted acetic acid C1 and that for EtAc separation C2 are even more energy-consuming (Figure 1).
Overall, 81.6% of the total required heat duty is consumed in these two columns. All three column
condensers consume 2851 kW of cooling duty, which corresponds to 94.6% of the total cooling duty
required. EX2, EX6, and EX7 heat exchangers consume less than 164 kW of cooling capacity to
reach the required stream temperature. Therefore, from the energetic point of view, the C1 and C2
columns are the key equipment units, Table 9. This is mainly due to large recycle ﬂows (Table 1) and
energy-intensive separation of the azeotropic mixture. The process is even more energy-intensive if
the C1column (Figure 1) is not operated as an azeotropic distillation column with an SEC of 3408 kW
of heating duty and 3427 kW of cooling duty. Overall, ﬁve main equipment units along with seven
heat exchangers are used (distillation columns reboilers and condensers are included as a part of the
main column equipment), Table 9.",0,process
615,615,"In the RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2), process energy demands are improved in
more ways. Both heat consumption and cooling demands in the RD column are improved by 40.4%
compared to the reaction part (CSTR reactor + C1 column) of the conventional process (Figure 1).
This is mainly due to the process integration and reduction of the ﬂow of some streams. The process
integration has a positive eﬀect on the regeneration of unreacted ethanol in distillation column C2
(Figure 2). Here, 361.9 kW of heat duty is consumed in the column reboiler; 323.1 kW of cooling
duty is required in the column condenser. This is by 34.1% less of reboiler duty and by 35.7% less
of condenser duty compared to regeneration column C3 in the conventional path (Figure 1). It is

618,618,"the most energy-consuming process. The C1 column (Figure 2) reboiler duty is 1760 kW, which is
by almost 28.0% more energy-intensive than the separation of pure EtAc in the conventional process
(Figure 1). A similar increase was observed for the cooling duty increase (around 30.7%) due to
diﬀerent content of EtAc in the column feed stream (F2); 65 mol.% in the RD with a separation unit
(Figure 2) compared to 77 mol.% in the conventional process (Figure 1). Consequently, EtAc separation
from diluted aqueous solution is more energy-intensive. Some energy savings can be reached when
higher water ﬂow to the decanter is used or a slightly diﬀerent column with higher packing height
is used. However, the RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2) is more energy-eﬃcient than the
conventional process (Figure 1). SEC is lower by 6.0% in case of both heat consumption and cooling
demands. Moreover, the number of equipment units is lower; CSTR and two heat exchangers have
been removed. Results can be found in Table 9.",0,process
619,619,"RD column with a stripper (Figure 3) shows signiﬁcant process integration and intensiﬁcation.
The process philosophy has been improved as several equipment were removed or integrated into the
main two columns (Figure 3). The RD column reboiler duty (556 kW) is 2.31 times lower compared to
that of the C1 stripper (Figure 3, 1286 kW). Also, vapor ﬂow in the stripper is almost three times higher
than that in the second section of the RD column. Energy demands of both columns (Figure 3) are quite
high compare to the conventional path (Figure 1) and the RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2).
In the designed RD column, the heat consumption decreased by almost 21% compared to the RD
column with a separation unit (Figure 2), (Table 9). The C1 stripper (Figure 3) reboiler duty is lower
by 26.8% compared to that of the C1 distillation column for EtAc separation in the RD column with
a separation unit (Figure 2). On the other hand, 1816 kW of cooling duty are required in the condenser
of the designed RD column (Figure 3), the highest cooling duty of all designed equipment, mainly due
to the large ﬂow of internal liquid recycle (D1 in Figure 3) and internal vapor recycle (AZ1 in Figure 3).
Fortunately, no other condenser is included in the process (Figure 3). Consequently, the RD column
condenser covers all main cooling demands. SEC has vastly decreased compared to the RD column
with a separation unit (Figure 2); heat consumption is by almost 35% lower as well as the cooling
duties (34.5%). The number of equipment units has decreased as a decanter, distillation column for
water regeneration and three heat exchangers have been eliminated. Results are listed in Table 9.",0,process
620,620,"RD column with an auxiliary reaction (Figure 4) represents a fully integrated and intensiﬁed
concept. Several aspects have brought signiﬁcant energy savings; the synergy of two chemical reactions
is used; reaction heat partially covers the process heating demands; product separation is enhanced
by increased relative volatility of produced EtAc to MEG; the number of equipment units has been
reduced to the RD column only. Designed RDAR energy requirements are very low compared to the
previously designed processes (Figures 1–3). SEC has vastly decreased; cooling duties are by more than
70% lower compared to the RDS (Figure 3); heat consumption is a tenth only of that in RDS. This can
be explained by the hydration reaction of ethylene oxide (7) which is highly exothermic, reaction heat
is −98,867.6 kJ kmol
C. Therefore, almost 275 kW of heat generated by the hydration reaction
is created in the RD column. This reaction-generated heat along with external heat (reboiler duty)
suﬃces to operate the RD column. Results are listed in Table 9.",0,process

732,732,"To complete the economic analysis, total capital costs, total annual costs, total raw material
cost, and product sales were calculated. A return rate of 20% per year and an annual work fund of
340 days were assumed. The capital costs are almost 10 mil. $ in the conventional path (Figure 1).
Process integration and intensiﬁcation can decrease total capital cost by 11% (RD column with
a separation unit); 35% (RDS); or even 57% (RDAR). Total raw materials cost is similar (5.45 mil. $)
except for RDAS (Figure 4) as the price of ethylene oxide has to be included. However, the highest
product sales are in the RDAS set-up (16.4 mil. $ compared to 10.3 mil. $). Finally, a simple payback
period was calculated: two years of project feasibility and preparation (projecting, building, licensing,
etc.) is included. The conventional process (Figure 1) has a payback period of over 10 years because of
the highest capital and utilities cost. RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2) becomes proﬁtable
1.5 years earlier than the conventional process (Figure 1). The payback period is almost halved in the
case of RDS (Figure 3), and only one-third in the case of RDAR (Figure 4) compared to the conventional
process (Figure 1). Finally, total production cost (TPC) was evaluated, Equation (2), and the results are
presented in Table 12. Comparison of total capital and annual costs with product sales are presented in
Figure 6. From Figure 6 and the TPC, it is clear that the most promising concepts are RDS (Figure 3)

756,756,"Individual risk is a risk assessment methodology that allows for numerical estimates of the level
of risk associated with a certain activity or a series of activities to be estimated and then assessed.
To identify the list of incidents a semi-automated approach was used. For each type of unit, a predeﬁned
set of representative incidents was prepared. The ﬁnal choice of incidents is very diﬃcult and requires
judgment from an analyst; therefore, three main factors were taken into consideration: the size
of the release, state of releasing material (liquid, vapor), and whether the release is instantaneous
or continuous.

757,757,"For distillation and reactive distillation columns, the incident list contained: liquid leaks (full bore
rupture and hole equivalent to 20% of diameter), vapor leaks, and complete rupture of column.
For heat exchangers, small leaks and full rupture were used.
For all pipelines in the simulation, the only full rupture was considered.",0,process

weather conditions (wind speed 1, 2, and 4 m s

To compare all investigated case studies, individual risk is presented in form of risk proﬁles as
a function of distance. Based on the risk proﬁles, it is possible to conclude that, from the safety point of
view, the conventional process set-up (Figure 1) and reactive distillation column with a separation
unit (Figure 2) are the worst alternatives. Both proﬁles are practically identical. Close to the center

765,765,"for existing plants (Table 13), the least suitable set-up is the distillation column with a separation unit
(Figure 2) due to the high number of equipment units but mainly due to the recirculation of large
quantities of material and high ﬂow rates through the columns.",0,process
766,766,"Based on the presented analysis, the best alternative, from the safety analysis point of view,
is the reactive distillation column with an auxiliary reaction. This result can be a little bit surprising
because in this case study, ethylene oxide (extremely ﬂammable, explosive, and toxic gas) is added
as a feedstock. On the other hand, the main advantage of this set-up (Figure 4) compared with the
previous three, is the minimal number of operation units and no material recycles. Main reactions
and separation are performed only in one unit (reactive distillation column and vapor and liquid
ﬂow through the column are lower than in all previous case studies. For this reason, the volume of
hazardous materials in the column, reboiler, and other auxiliary equipment are also lower compared to
the previous case studies. The concentration of the extremely ﬂammable ethylene oxide is very low
in the column and its mole fraction in the whole system is below 10%; except for 10 trays close to its
feed location.",0,process
767,767,"From the comparison of individual risk of fatality estimation (Figure 7 resp. Table 13), it is clear

reliable parameters was used for phase equilibrium calculations. Chemical reactions (esteriﬁcation
(5) and hydration (7)) were modeled by rate Equations (6) and (8) obtained from extensive literature
research. A rigorous non-equilibrium stage model of the distillation/reactive distillation column
was used. Detailed column internal conﬁguration was designed (packed column) and therefore,
more accurate simulation results were obtained including reasonable column hydraulics.",0,process

other product streams (full EtAc recovery); separation of process by-products (water or monoethylene
glycol) in equal amount and purity as the main product (EtAc)). This was successfully achieved in
all designed processes (Figures 1–4). In the conventional process set-up (Figure 1), regeneration was
energy-intensive due to large recycle ﬂows. Energy requirements for recycle regeneration decreased
signiﬁcantly due to process integration. Regeneration was less energy-intensive in the case of RD
column with a separation unit (Figure 2) compared to the conventional set-up (Figure 1, by around 35%).
No process stream regeneration was needed in the case of either RDS (Figure 3) or RDAR (Figure 4).
Therefore, energy consumption was reduced by process integration and intensiﬁcation remarkably.
The lowest energy consumption was achieved in a fully integrated and intensiﬁed process—RDAR
(Figure 4), due to the synergy of two chemical reactions and enhanced product separation (Table 9).",0,process
783,783,"Economic and energy aspects showed similar trends in the designed processes. The total utility
costs were the highest in the case of commercial process set-up (Figure 1)—almost 0.9 mil. $ per year.
Savings of 10% in the utility costs were observed when the conventional process (Figure 1) was replaced
by an RD column with a separation unit (Figure 2). Further utilities cost savings were achieved by
RD process integration and intensiﬁcation via RDS (Figure 3), up to 39%, and via RDAR (Figure 4) up
to 88%, respectively. More remarkable savings were observed in total capital cost (TCC) (Table 12).
As the number of equipment units was reduced, TCC decreased accordingly. On the other hand,
the price of individual equipment units increased because of larger columns with sophisticated internal
conﬁguration. Detailed prices of individual equipment are listed in the Appendix A in Table A1.",0,process
784,784,"An integral part of the intensiﬁcation process of ethyl acetate production is the safety analysis.
To translate the probability and impact of risk into a measurable quantity, individual risk estimation
was used. Results in the form of risk proﬁles can be easily compared for several alternatives of ethyl
acetate production and prioritize the safer ones. From the safety analysis point of view, a reactive
distillation column with an auxiliary reaction (Figure 4) comes out as the best alternative even though
ethylene oxide (extremely ﬂammable, explosive, and toxic gas) is added as feedstock. This is due to
the minimum number of equipment and the elimination of recycles in the system.",0,process
