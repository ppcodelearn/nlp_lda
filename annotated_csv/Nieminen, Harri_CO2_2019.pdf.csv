3,"Abstract: Synthesis of methanol from recirculated CO2 and H2 produced by water electrolysis allows
sustainable production of fuels and chemical storage of energy. Production of renewable methanol
has, however, not achieved commercial breakthrough, and novel methods to improve economic
feasibility are needed. One possibility is to alter the reaction route to methanol using catalytic
alcoholic solvents, which makes the process possible at lower reaction temperatures. To estimate the
techno-economic potential of this approach, the feasibilities of the conventional gas-phase process
and an alternative liquid-phase process employing 2-butanol or 1-butanol solvents were compared by
means of ﬂowsheet modelling and economic analysis. As a result, it was found that despite improved
methanol yield, the presence of solvent adds complexity to the process and increases separation costs
due to the high volatility of the alcohols and formation of azeotropes. Hydrogen, produced from
wind electricity, was the major cost in all processes. The higher cost of the present, non-optimized
liquid-phase process is largely explained by the heat required in separation. If this heat could be
provided by heat integration, the resulting production costs approach the costs of the gas-phase
process. It is concluded that the novel reaction route provides promising possibilities, but new
breakthroughs in process synthesis, integration, optimization, and catalysis are needed before the
alcoholic solvent approach surpasses the traditional gas-phase process.",0

5,1. Introduction,0
6,"The synthesis of liquid fuels from hydrogen using captured CO2 as the carbon source would allow
sustainable fuel production with the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in the energy and transportation
sectors [1], while simultaneously providing an option for the chemical storage of intermittent renewable
electricity [2]. Such an approach could potentially make a signiﬁcant contribution to decarbonization
of the energy system [3]. Methanol provides an example of such a liquid energy carrier [4].",0
7,"Methanol is both an important industrial chemical and a useful multi-purpose fuel [5]. It can also
be readily converted into products such as gasoline in the methanol-to-gasoline process (MTG) [6]
or oleﬁns in the methanol-to-oleﬁns process (MTO) [7]. At present, most methanol comes from the
catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (syngas) that is usually generated by steam reforming of natural
gas [8]. The syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, CO, and CO2, is converted into methanol on copper
and zinc oxide (Cu/ZnO)-based catalysts at temperatures of 200–300
C and pressures of 50–100 bar.
The methanol synthesis process can be described by three equilibrium reactions:",0

20,"Equations (1) and (2) represent the exothermic hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to methanol, and
Equation (3) represents the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction that is activated by the copper-based
methanol synthesis catalysts [8]. As Reactions (1) and (2) are exothermic and result in a reduction
of molar volume, methanol synthesis is favored at low temperatures and high pressures. However,
suﬃciently fast reaction kinetics requires temperatures above 200
C, and methanol conversion is thus
limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium.",0
21,◦,0
22,"Alternative to syngas, methanol can be produced by directly hydrogenating pure CO2 with
H2 with high selectivity on conventional Cu/ZnO-based catalysts. However, the reaction rates are
lower than with syngas feeds [9]. The equilibrium conversions are also lower compared to CO
hydrogenation [10]. In addition to the thermodynamic limitation, methanol synthesis from pure CO2 is
complicated because of the increased water formation. In the absence of CO, water is produced both as
the by-product of CO2 hydrogenation (Equation (1)) and by the reverse-water gas shift reaction (reverse
of Equation (3)). The increased formation of water leads to kinetic inhibition [11] and accelerated
deactivation [12] of the Cu/ZnO catalysts.",0
23,"The economic feasibility of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has been explored in a number
of studies. While some studies paid close attention to the design and modelling of the methanol
synthesis process [13–16], others focused on the electrolysis technology [17], electricity sources [18,19],
or grid-scale implementation in a future renewable-based energy system [20]. Some studies have
considered sustainability and environmental metrics in more detail [21,22]. Comparisons of methanol
against other alternative energy carrier compounds have also been made [23]. Concerning the
economics of the process, however, these studies draw signiﬁcantly diﬀerent conclusions. For example,
Mignard et al. [13] and Anicic et al. [15] found the methanol production costs from CO2 to be potentially
competitive with fossil-based methanol production. In contrast, Pérez-Fortes [16] and Tremel et al. [23]
found the production costs to be substantially higher than current methanol market prices. The overall
costs have generally been found to be dominated by the hydrogen production costs, which consist of
the electrolyzer capital costs and the cost of electricity.",0
24,"There have been attempts to lower methanol processing costs by replacing the conventional
gas-phase process with alternative liquid-phase processes. In the LPMeOH (liquid-phase methanol)
process, the reaction is carried out in inert hydrocarbon solvent, allowing eﬀective heat control
of the exothermic reaction [24]. A demonstration-scale process has shown stable performance in
conversion of coal-derived syngas with varying composition. Alternatively, methanol synthesis in
co-catalytic alcoholic solvents has also been presented [25,26]. In the alcoholic solvent, methanol
synthesis proceeds by an altered reaction mechanism via the formate ester of the alcohol, allowing
lowered reaction temperatures. The lower temperature in turn allows higher equilibrium conversion
in methanol synthesis.",0
25,"The kinetics of the alcohol-promoted methanol synthesis process has been widely studied at
the laboratory scale [25,26]. However, the techno-economic potential of this novel process has not
been thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study is to assess the techno-economic feasibility
of the liquid-phase alcohol-based process of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. For this purpose,
the alcohol-promoted process with two alternative solvents is compared to the gas-phase process by
means of process ﬂowsheet simulation and subsequent economic analysis. 2-Butanol was selected
as the primary solvent due to the good catalytic performance shown in experimental studies [27,28].
However, 1-butanol was also considered to assess whether a higher solvent boiling point would
be favorable for the overall process eﬃciency and economics. It should be noted that published
experimental details on the alcohol-promoted process are relatively limited, and the thermodynamics
and kinetics have not been established in detail. Thus, the present work aims to provide a preliminary
feasibility analysis rather than a rigorous optimization of the process alternatives. The key objectives",0

reactor. In the process with alcohol solvents, signiﬁcant evaporation of the solvent took place, and
the solvent vapors were removed together with the product vapors and gases. The solvent was then
separated in downstream processing and returned to the reactor. Due to the lack of any detailed kinetic
model for the alcohol promoted reaction route, the reactor in all liquid-phase processes was modelled
with the RCSTR block based on the thermodynamic equilibrium by Gibbs energy minimization. In the

was achieved in laboratory experiments under kinetics-controlled conditions with an approximate
catalyst volume fraction of 1% in the slurry. In the present design, the same rate was assumed with

the process. These emissions consisted of CO2 present in outlet streams, the CO2 emitted in steam
generation, and the indirect emissions of grid electricity. The speciﬁc electricity consumption (per t
MeOH) of the processes was calculated, and the corresponding CO2 emission was estimated from the
carbon intensity of the Finnish electricity grid at the time of writing (170 g CO2/kWh) [35]. For steam
generation, emissions from both the combustion of externally-supplied fuel (natural gas) and the
combustion of process waste streams were considered. Cooling water input and waste water output
were considered in the water balance. The mass ﬂow rate and composition of the waste water streams,
consisting of water/alcohol mixtures, were assessed.",0

by a material factor of 1.3 [36] and by a location factor of 1.043 corresponding to Western Europe [16].
The reactor’s cost in the liquid-phase process was based on the sizing procedure described above.

the production cost of wind-based hydrogen was in the range of $2.90–3.40/kg, including hydrogen
storage. The production cost of wind electricity in the Finnish scenario has been recently estimated at
41.4 €/MWh [38]. This value is fairly consistent with the wind electricity cost ($0.038/kWh) used by
Levene et al. [37]. The hydrogen cost is also consistent with Smolinka et al. [39], who estimated a value
of 3.17 €/kg for large-scale alkaline electrolysis with intermittent operation (average capacity factor
35%). All the electricity available from the wind farm was utilized in the electrolysis unit. In order to
maintain constant operation, the methanol synthesis unit was powered by grid electricity, available at

fraction of water over the reactor length was essentially identical to that of methanol. The reactions
modelled here, i.e., CO2 hydrogenation to methanol (Equation (1)) and the reverse-water gas shift
(RWGS, Equation (3)), reached equilibrium after one meter of reactor length. Due to the low contribution
of the reactor capital cost to the overall production cost (Section 3.4), this was considered satisfactory,
and further reactor optimization was omitted. At this point, the peak temperature inside the reactor
(274.5
C) was reached, and 20.3% of the CO2 entering the reactor was converted. Thus, a signiﬁcant
amount of unreacted gases was recycled, and the recycle ratio equaled 5.3 in the reactor loop. CO2 was
converted to methanol at a selectivity of 96.1%. The mole fraction of CO remained low throughout the
reactor length, and the constant concentration of CO after approximately 0.5 m corresponded to the

gases from the separators FLASH2 and FLASH3 (see the ﬂowsheet in Figure 2). The majority of the
methanol loss occurred in the purge from FLASH2. Due to the large amount of unreacted CO2 and the

the decanter. This loss is explained by the alcohol-water azeotrope. A signiﬁcant amount was also lost
with the liquid purge stream, which could only be minimized based on detailed information on the
formation and accumulation of by-products. Overall, the fraction of solvent lost was 2% for 2-butanol

more energy-intensive separation stage. In addition, less heat was available from the reactor due

economics of the various methanol synthesis processes. The sensitivity analysis was performed in
terms of the methanol production cost, and NPV was not considered in the analysis. The cost of
hydrogen, constituting a major fraction of the overall cost, was included in the sensitivity analysis.
In addition, the eﬀects of the costs of oxygen, CO2, and the total capital investment were also analyzed.
The gas-phase process and the 1-butanol process were selected for the sensitivity analysis. The cost of
solvent was also included as a variable for the 1-butanol process. The results for the gas-phase process
are shown in Figure 8, and those for the 1-butanol process are shown in Figure 9.",0

317,"As expected from Figure 6, the cost of hydrogen was found to have the highest impact on the
overall cost. In the gas-phase process, the overall production cost was 612 €/t at a hydrogen cost 50% of
the base value, corresponding to a hydrogen cost of 1500 €/t. In the 1-butanol process, the production
cost was 878 €/t at the hydrogen cost of 1500 €/t. The cost of hydrogen generated by water electrolysis
was expected to decrease with the development of electrolyzer technology and the decreasing cost of
renewable electricity. The decline in the cost of photovoltaic electricity has been particularly quick [50],
potentially providing a more competitive route to renewable methanol compared to wind electricity in
the near future. At the same time, the electrolyzer capital costs are expected to decrease, particularly in
the case of more advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide (SOEC) electrolyzers [51].
Clearly, a signiﬁcant reduction in the hydrogen cost would be required to make these processes
competitive at present methanol prices. The hydrogen cost required to reach a methanol cost of 400 €/t
was approximately 600 €/t for the gas-phase process. For the 1-butanol process, this threshold was not
reached even at zero hydrogen cost.",0
318,"Due to the high contribution of operating costs to the overall production cost, the economics of
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol were not particularly sensitive to the capital investment. The economic
impact of oxygen sales was apparent. If oxygen was not sold at all, the methanol production cost
increased to 1028 €/t in the gas-phase process and 1266 €/t in the 1-pentanol process. The impact of
oxygen sales was found to be higher than that of the CO2 cost. Similar to the hydrogen cost, the cost of
CO2 capture is expected to decrease with technological development. However, the economics of the
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process do not seem to be heavily aﬀected by these developments.",0
319,3.6. Summary,0
320,"The beneﬁts and challenges of the liquid-phase CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process compared
to the gas-phase process are qualitatively summarized in Table 8. The advantage of the liquid-phase
process was the increased per pass conversion due to the lower reaction temperature and the apparent
favorable distribution of products between the gas and liquid phases in the reactor. At the same
reaction pressure of 50 bar, the per pass CO2 conversion was increased from 20% in the gas-phase
process to 79% in the 2-butanol process and 81% in the 1-butanol phase process. The conversion in
the liquid-phase processes was higher than the single-phase equilibrium conversion at the reaction
conditions. This is presumably due to the beneﬁcial phase equilibrium, i.e., the evaporation of products
from the reacting liquid phase. However, uncertainties in the prediction of the phase distribution
were present due to a lack of experimental data at the reaction conditions. In addition, whereas the
gas-phase reaction could be modelled in detail using an available kinetic model, the liquid-phase
reactions were modelled as equilibrium reactions without considering the reaction kinetics. In practice,
the reaction rates in the liquid-phase process should be similar in magnitude to the gas-phase process
in order to avoid excessively large reactor volumes.",0
321,"In the gas-phase process, large amounts of gases are recycled in the reactor loop and purged
from the process. As a result, the overall methanol yield was only 81%. In the liquid-phase processes,
the overall methanol yield was 82% with 2-butanol and 88% with 1-butanol. However, the introduction
of the solvent led to a more complicated overall process due to the complex phase equilibrium
and mutual solubility of the reactants, products, and solvent, as well as increased demands on the
separation stage. The large amounts of solvent present led to increased capital and energy intensity of
the separation stage. The diﬀerence was manifested in the overall energy balance of the gas-phase
and liquid-phase processes. While the gas-phase process produced a net heat output, the liquid phase
processes required a signiﬁcant net heat input, together with increased cooling duties. However, the
energy consumption of the liquid-phase processes could be improved by more rigorous heat integration.
The diﬀerent alcohols used as solvents had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the energy consumption and
overall methanol production cost. Compared to 2-butanol, whose boiling point is similar to that
of water, the heat eﬃciency of the process was signiﬁcantly improved by using 1-butanol, which
possesses a higher boiling point. Ideally, even higher boiling point solvents would be used to simplify",0
322,"Processes 2019, 7, 405",0
323,19 of 24,0
324,"the separation, potentially allowing selective evaporation of methanol and water from the reactor.
However, the solvent should also be suﬃciently active in the alcohol-promoted reaction to obtain
reasonable reaction rates at low reaction temperatures. Development of increasingly active catalyst
systems could allow even lower reaction temperatures, further increasing the equilibrium conversion.
For example, Chen et al. [52] demonstrated a heterogeneous cascade catalytic system for liquid-phase
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at 135
C, with the reaction promoted by ethanol. The beneﬁcial
eﬀect of the phase distribution in the liquid-phase reactor to the equilibrium conversion level, found in
the present process modelling work, should also be experimentally veriﬁed and further investigated.
Another approach to increase the equilibrium conversion and reaction rate could be provided by the
adsorption of water from the reaction mixture [53] or by in situ condensation of water and methanol [54].",0

353,"Additional costs to the liquid-phase process were caused by the loss of solvent. Two percent of
2-butanol and 3% of 1-butanol and 2-butanol entering the reactor were lost in downstream processing
in the present processes. The loss was explained by the alcohol forming azeotropic mixtures with water.
Without the introduction of an additional, complicated separation sequence to break the azeotropes,
a fraction of the solvent was necessarily lost with the waste water removed from the process.",0
354,"Environmental analysis was performed in terms of the CO2 and water balances and the electricity
consumption of the studied processes. The net CO2 balance of the gas-phase and 1-butanol processes
was found to be negative, i.e., the processes consumed more CO2 than was released. However, the CO2
balance was positive for the 2-butanol processes. The lowest net CO2 emission, −3.0 t/h, was found
with the gas-phase process, which did not require fuel combustion for heat generation. The hot
utility requirement of the liquid-phase processes led to increased emissions. The net emission was
−1.2 t/h with the 1-butanol process and 216 t/h with the 2-butanol process. The impact of the CO2
emitted in electricity generation was insigniﬁcant as regards the process CO2 balances. The gas-phase
process produced the lowest ﬂow rate of waste water (1371 kg/h), with a methanol content of 1.11 wt%.
The 2-butanol process produced 1573 kg/h, and the 1-butanol process produced 1644 kg/h of waste
water, both streams with an alcohol content of 9 wt%.",0
355,"In terms of overall methanol production costs, the gas-phase process appeared more competitive
than the liquid-phase processes, having a production cost of 963 €/t. This value appears to be consistent
with previous studies. For example, Atsonios et al. [18], Rivera-Tinoco et al. [17], and Tremel et al. [23]
estimated costs between 800 and 1000 €/t at production scales comparable to the present study.
Pérez-Fortes et al. [16] estimated a break-even methanol price of 724 €/t for large industrial-scale
production at a hydrogen cost of 3090 €/t (compared to 3000 €/t in the present study). However,",0
356,"Processes 2019, 7, 405",0
357,20 of 24,0
358,"signiﬁcantly lower costs have been reported by other authors [15,32,55,56]. For instance, Anicic
et al. [15] found the cost of methanol produced from captured CO2 and hydrogen from electrolysis
(below 400 €/t) to be competitive with fossil fuel-based methanol production. It appears that this
variation was a result of the diﬀerent assumptions and methods employed in the analyses.",0
359,"In the liquid-phase process, the production cost was 1205 €/t with 1-butanol and 1349 €/t with
2-butanol. The costs were 25% and 40% higher compared to the gas-phase process. The higher
costs compared to the gas-phase process were explained by the more complex and energy-intensive
separation stage and the added cost of the solvent make-up. The variation in the production cost for
diﬀerent liquid solvents was explained by the diﬀerent capital costs and especially the energy costs of
the distillation stage.",0
360,"In all the processes considered here, the overall production cost was dominated by variable
operating costs, especially the cost of hydrogen (73%, 48%, and 54% of the total production cost in
the gas-phase, 2-butanol, and 1-butanol processes, respectively). As a result, the overall methanol
production cost was highly sensitive to the cost of hydrogen. In the gas-phase process, a hydrogen cost
of 600 €/t would be required to lower the methanol production cost to 400 €/t, representing the present
methanol price. The liquid-phase processes did not meet this threshold value even at zero hydrogen
cost. The heating costs in the 1-butanol process corresponded to 174 €/t MeOH. At present, none of
the processes appeared economically feasible, with the 20-year net present values of −87 M€ for the
gas-phase process, −128 M€ for the 1-butanol process, and −145 M€ for the 2-butanol process.
4. Conclusions",0
361,"The feasibility of alternative CO2 hydrogenation to methanol processes was compared by means
of ﬂowsheet modelling and economic analysis. The processes compared included a conventional
gas-phase process and a liquid-phase process with 2-butanol and 1-butanol as alternative solvents.
The potential beneﬁt of the liquid-phase processes was that lower reaction temperatures were allowed
by the co-catalytic activity of the alcoholic solvent. At the same reaction pressure of 50 bar, the per pass
conversion of CO2 in the reactor was increased from 20% in the gas-phase process to approximately
80% in the liquid-phase processes. The conversion in the liquid-phase processes was higher than the
single-phase equilibrium conversion at the reaction conditions, apparently due to the evaporation of
reaction products from the reacting liquid phase. As a result of the decreased amount of recycled gases,
the overall conversion of CO2 to methanol of 81% in the gas-phase process was increased to 82% and
88% in the 2-butanol and 1-butanol processes, respectively.",0
362,"The beneﬁts of the increased equilibrium conversion were found to be limited to slightly lower
capital and operating costs in the reactor loop. However, the presence of large quantities of solvent
in the reactor eﬄuent led to a capital- and energy-intensive separation stage, which required two
distillation columns compared to one in the gas-phase process. In addition, the formation of azeotropes
between the alcohols and the water by-product complicated the separation and led to losses of solvent.
Due to the increased energy consumption and the cost of solvent make-up, the methanol production
cost of the most competitive liquid-phase process (1-butanol) was 1205 €/t, compared to the production
cost of 963 €/t for the gas-phase process. The cost of heating in the 1-butanol process corresponded
to 174 €/t MeOH, and if the heat requirement could be eliminated by process or site heat integration,
the resulting methanol production cost would equal 1031 €/t.",0
363,"None of the processes, in gas or liquid phases, were competitive at the present methanol price
of approximately 400 €/t. The 20-year net present values of the gas-phase process and the 1-butanol
and 2-butanol processes were estimated at −87 M€, −128 M€, and −145 M€, respectively. Hydrogen
constituted the largest fraction of the overall cost in all processes, at 73%, 48%, and 54% in the above
processes, respectively. In terms of CO2 emissions, the most favorable CO2 balance was found with the
gas-phase process, with a net consumption of 3.0 t/h of CO2. The 1-butanol process also showed a
negative CO2 balance, with a net CO2 consumption of 1.2 t/h. Due to the higher amount of utility heat
required, the 2-butanol process showed positive net emission of 0.2 t/h of CO2. The water balance of",0
364,"Processes 2019, 7, 405",0
365,21 of 24,0
366,"the gas-phase was also the most favorable, with the smallest amount of waste water released at the
lowest alcohol content. The amount of and composition of waste water produced was similar in each
of the liquid-phase processes.",0
367,"To conclude, a feasible preliminary process design for the liquid-phase methanol synthesis process
was developed. However, further optimization and improved heat integration are required to improve
the process economics. Due to the greater complexity and less favorable energy balance of the
liquid-phase process, the estimated methanol production cost was found to be 25% and 40% higher
with the 1-butanol and 2-butanol processes compared to the baseline gas-phase process. It should be
noted that signiﬁcant assumptions and simpliﬁcations were made in modelling of the liquid-phase
processes. In particular, reaction kinetics were not considered, and the equilibrium reactor model used
presented a “best-case scenario” of the reactor performance. More detailed experimental information
on reaction kinetics, yields, and thermodynamics is required to allow more in-depth modelling of the
liquid-phase reaction system.",0
368,"Regardless of these limitations, it is concluded that the liquid-phase CO2 hydrogenation to
methanol process shows potential, and the present ﬁndings provide valuable information for further
development. The main advantage of the alcohol-promoted liquid-phase process is the higher
equilibrium conversion allowed by operation at lower temperatures, and future development should
aim to further increase the conversion levels to approach ideally full single-pass conversion. Possibilities
include increasingly active catalyst/solvent systems allowing even lower reaction temperatures, removal
of water from the reactor by means of adsorption, or in situ condensation of water and methanol from
a gaseous reaction mixture. The apparent beneﬁcial eﬀect of the phase distribution in the liquid-phase
reactor should also be investigated further, and both the co-catalytic eﬀect and ease of separation
should be considered in the selection of alcoholic solvents. More advanced reactor designs (e.g.,
reactive distillation) and separation methods (e.g., dividing wall columns) should also be considered,
together with energy provision by heat pumps to decrease the cost and CO2 intensity of the processes.",0
