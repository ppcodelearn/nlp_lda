3,"Abstract: In order to increase the typically low equilibrium CO2 conversion to methanol using
commercially proven technology, the addition of two intermediate condensation units between
reaction steps is evaluated in this work. Detailed process simulations with heat integration and
techno-economic analyses of methanol synthesis from green H2 and captured CO2 are presented here,
comparing the proposed process with condensation steps with the conventional approach. In the new
process, a CO2 single-pass conversion of 53.9% was achieved, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the
conversion of the conventional process (28.5%) and its equilibrium conversion (30.4%). Consequently,
the total recycle stream ﬂow was halved, which reduced reactant losses in the purge stream and the
compression work of the recycle streams, lowering operating costs by 4.8% (61.2 M€·a−1). In spite of
the additional number of heat exchangers and ﬂash drums related to the intermediate condensation
units, the ﬁxed investment costs of the improved process decreased by 22.7% (94.5 M€). This was a
consequence of the increased reaction rates and lower recycle ﬂows, reducing the required size of the
main equipment. Therefore, intermediate condensation steps are beneﬁcial for methanol synthesis
from H2/CO2, signiﬁcantly boosting CO2 single-pass conversion, which consequently reduces both
the investment and operating costs.",0

6,"Sustainable solutions are required to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the
transportation and industrial sectors, shrinking the dependency on fossil fuels. With the
continuously increasing installed capacity of wind and solar power plants [1], adequate
energy storage solutions have to be implemented in order to deal with their ﬂuctuating
nature. Therefore, the conversion of electricity into valuable chemicals and fuels, a concept
often called power-to-fuels or power-to-X, can make an important contribution to the
future energy system [2]. In this context, key process steps are hydrogen generation via
electrolysis (primary conversion) [3,4] and methanol synthesis (secondary conversion) [5].
Methanol can be used as a fuel substitute or additive, either in fuel cells or via
combustion [2], as a feedstock in the production of base chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde)
and liquid fuels (e.g., gasoline, oxymethylene ethers, jetfuel) [6–8], and also as a solvent.
Methanol fuel has recently attracted signiﬁcant interest, especially in China, where the
consumption of methanol for thermal applications (e.g., boilers, kilns, cooking stoves) and
in the transportation section amounted to 5.7 Mton·a−1 (year 2019) [9].
The current global capacity of methanol production is 164 Mton·a−1 (year 2021), with
an annual increase of 10% projected for the next decade [10]. Traditionally, methanol
synthesis is fed by fossil-based syngas, which comes either from steam reforming of natural
gas or from coal gasiﬁcation [11]. However, sustainable syngas production is gaining",0

18,"The current world-scale technology for methanol synthesis is mostly based on the
application of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) catalysts in either multi-tube reactors with boiling
water as the cooling ﬂuid, normally called isothermal reactors (e.g., the Lurgi process, the
Linde process), or adiabatic reactors with intermediate cold syngas quenching, generally
named quench reactors (e.g., ICI and the Casale process, the Haldor Topsoe process) [11,13].
Less common but also industrially applied are the adiabatic reactors with intermediate
cooling (e.g., the Kellogg process, the Toyo process) [11,14]. Normally, temperatures
between 200 and 300 ◦C and pressures between 50 and 100 bar are applied [13].",0
19,"Methanol can be produced from either CO (Equation (1)) or CO2 (Equation (2)),
with the reverse water–gas shift reaction (rWGSR, Equation (3)) also occurring. If the
feed gas contains both CO and CO2, there is a prevailing opinion that direct CO hy-
drogenation (Equation (1)) on Cu/Zn-based catalysts is signiﬁcantly slower than CO2
hydrogenation [15,16], and kinetic models not considering this reaction can adequately
simulate experimental data [17–19].",0

was considered in both studies, with the plant being energetically self-sufﬁcient. Cordero-
Lanzac et al. [22] simulated the production of 275 kton MeOH·a−1 with an In2O3/Co
catalyst. In all studies, it was concluded that economic viability can be achieved if reactant
prices signiﬁcantly decrease or if CO2 taxation is enforced. Nonetheless, it is expected
that the costs of electrolysis and CCUs might considerably decrease in the foreseeable
future [23,24], and the ﬁrst industrial-scale plants to produce e-methanol and e-gasoline
are expected to start operating in 2024–2025 [25,26].",0
30,"A general argument is the thermodynamic restrictions of CO2 conversion to methanol
compared to CO conversion (see Figure 2), whereby only limited methanol yields are
achievable even at elevated pressures and lower temperatures. Consequently, a low CO2
single-pass conversion (XCO2,SP) is obtained independently of the reactor size, leading to
large recycle streams, which increase operating costs and cause higher reactant losses in
purge streams.",0

32,"If the products (i.e., methanol and water) are removed from the reacting system, the
thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted towards a higher methanol yield. This strategy
has been studied using alternative reactor designs with in situ condensation [27,28] or
membrane reactors [29], but these technologies are not yet ready for commercialization.
A feasible approach using commercially proven technology is the implementation of
intermediate condensation steps between reactor units displaced in series. In the Davy
series loop methanol process, two reactors with an intermediate condensation unit are
proposed for large scale methanol production from CO-rich syngas [13,30]. Although the
implementation of intermediate condensation steps is a promising strategy to increase
methanol yield from H2/CO2 syngas, such an approach has still not received particular
attention, and plant simulations with heat integration and techno-economic analyses are
not available in the literature yet, to the best of our knowledge.",0
33,"In this work, the conventional approach (named here the ‘one-step process’) is com-
pared with a new alternative approach including two condensation steps (named here the
‘three-step process’). Using our recently developed kinetic model for methanol synthesis [19],
both processes were implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze and select key
process parameters (i.e., cooling ﬂuid temperature, number of reactor modules, and purge
fraction). With the optimized parameters, detailed methanol synthesis plants with heat inte-
gration were implemented in Aspen Plus, and techno-economic analyses were performed.",0

36,"2. Methodology
2.1. Process Overview",1
37,"In the present work, a methanol synthesis plant from H2/CO2 with a production of
145 ton·h−1 is considered. This value is based on an ongoing power-to-gasoline project
via H2/CO2 conversion to methanol [26], whose ﬁnal goal is a gasoline production of
5.5·108 L·a−1, which corresponds to a methanol production of 1.16 Mton·a−1 or 145 ton·h−1
(assuming a yield of 80% in the methanol-to-gasoline process and plant operating hours
of 8000 h·a−1).
In our simulations, feed carbon dioxide comes from the cleaned ﬂue gas of nearby
industries (e.g., a cement industry) at 25 ◦C and 1 bar, with a purity of 99.5% mol/mol (the
rest was water). Feed hydrogen comes from water electrolysis at 25 ◦C and 30 bar, with a
purity of 99.5% mol/mol (the rest was nitrogen). Although it is possible to obtain these
feedstocks in an extremely high purity (e.g., 99.99% mol/mol) [31,32], we chose a more
conservative scenario, which also allows a proper simulation of inert material accumulation
in the plant.",1
38,"As pressure has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the thermodynamic equilibrium of methanol
synthesis (see Figure 2), the reactor operating pressure was set to 70 bar. Although higher
pressures are reported to have potential in methanol synthesis [33,34], they were out
of the scope of this work, since considerable extrapolations in the kinetic model would
be necessary, and condensation inside the reactor might have to be taken into account.
Besides, higher pressures increase compression costs and might also require more expensive
materials to build the equipment.",1
39,"The dimensions of the reactor modules were chosen to be close to the upper size
limits that are currently commercially available. That is, each reactor module consisted of
a shell containing 33,000 tubes with 12.5 m length and an inner diameter of 3.75 cm.
Since the heat generation in CO2 hydrogenation is lower than in CO hydrogenation
(Equations (1) and (2)), less heat transfer area is necessary. Because of that, the tube inner
diameter chosen in this work (3.75 cm) was larger than the size typically used for CO
conversion to methanol (2.5 cm). Considering 1050 kg·m−3 as the apparent catalyst bed
density [35], the total CZA catalyst loading of each reactor module was 478.13 ton. A total
pressure loss of 0.75 bar was considered for each reactor module [36].",1
40,2.1.1. One-Step Approach—Process Description,1
41,"In Figure 3, a detailed ﬂowsheet of the one-step process is presented. This is an
adapted version from a concept reported in the literature [37–39]. Feed CO2 is mixed
with a low-pressure recycle stream, and then compressed from 1 to 70 bar in a three-stage
process, including intermediate cooling (reducing compression work) and intermediate
phase separation (to remove condensed methanol and water from the recycle stream). The
resulting compressed stream is mixed with feed H2 (compressed from 30 to 70 bar in one
stage) and with a high pressure recycle stream. The mixed stream is preheated with the
product gas and enters the inner tubes of parallel reactor modules, with the temperature
being controlled by boiling water on the shell side.
The product stream is cooled down to 30 ◦C in four heat exchangers, condensing
water, methanol, and some CO2, which are separated from the light gases in a ﬂash drum.
A fraction of the gas stream is purged, and the remaining stream is recompressed to 70 bar
and recycled. The liquid stream from the ﬂash drum is depressurized to 1 bar and heated
to 30 ◦C, vaporizing most remaining CO2. A liquid–gas separation is performed in another
ﬂash drum. A fraction of the gas stream from the low-pressure ﬂash drum is purged, and
the rest is recycled by mixing with feed CO2. The liquid stream from the low-pressure
ﬂash drum is preheated and fed to a packed column, where methanol in high purity
(>99.5% m/m) is recovered in the liquid distillate, water is recovered in the bottom, and
most of the remaining CO2 is recovered in the gas distillate.",1

44,"Figure 3. One-step process—detailed ﬂowsheet with a total of three reactor modules. Cooling water
streams are omitted.",1
45,"The purge streams are burned with 15% air excess in a ﬁred heater [40]. The heat of
reaction of both the purge combustion and the methanol synthesis are used in a water
Rankine cycle to produce electricity. The cycle starts with liquid water at 1 bar and 99.6 ◦C
being pumped to a certain pressure, whose boiling temperature corresponds to the desired
reactor temperature. Pressurized water reaches its boiling temperature in two steps (heat
exchanger and ﬁred heater) and vaporizes inside the reactor modules. The produced
saturated steam is further heated in the ﬁred heater and then performs work in a turbine,
with a discharge pressure of 1.43 bar (Tboiling = 110 ◦C). The resulting low-pressure steam
condenses partially in the column reboiler, and total condensation is completed in a heat
exchanger, closing the water cycle.",1
46,2.1.2. Three-Step Approach—Process Description,1
47,"In Figure 4, a detailed ﬂowsheet of the three-step process is presented. In this approach,
the feed compression and recycling of non-converted reactants occurs similarly to the one-
step process. The mixed feed stream is preheated and enters the ﬁrst reactor module. The
product gas is cooled down to 45 ◦C in three steps, and the condensed stream (mostly water,
methanol, and some CO2) is separated from the light gases in a ﬂash drum. The gas stream
is preheated and enters the second reactor module. The second product gas is cooled down
to 30 ◦C in three steps, and the condensed stream (mostly water, methanol, and some CO2)
is separated from the gas stream in another ﬂash drum.",1

stages, and further cooled down to 30 ◦C.",1
52,"Similar to the one-step process, component separation of the product stream is per-
formed with one ﬂash drum at high pressure, one ﬂash drum at ambient pressure, and one
distillation column.",1
53,"The purge stream is burned in a ﬁred heater with preheated air. In the water cycle,
pressurized water is preheated and distributed to the reactor modules. A fraction of the
produced saturated steam is split and used to preheat the water while the remaining steam
is further heated in the ﬁred heater. Supersaturated steam performs work in a turbine, with
a discharge pressure of 1.43 bar (Tboiling = 110 ◦C). The resulting low-pressure steam is
partially condensed in the column reboiler, and total condensation is completed in a heat
exchanger, closing the water cycle.",1

total number of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the temperature of the cooling
ﬂuid in the reactor.",0
58,"In order to simulate the reactor, the following considerations were made: there are only
variations along the length of the reactor (1D assumption), the inﬂuence of back-mixing is
neglected (plug ﬂow assumption), and the cooling ﬂuid temperature (Tw, in K) is constant.

column were extracted. For example, in the column of the one-step process, the methanol
distribution in the outlet streams was: 3.80% in the gas distillate, 96.13% in the liquid
distillate, and 0.06% in the bottom. The split ratio of all the components were taken from
Aspen Plus and were considered constant for the different scenarios investigated in Matlab
(i.e., variations in the number of reactor modules, purge fraction, and Tw). These split ratios
are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section C).",0

the optimal temperature for a ﬁxed methanol production (145 ton·h−1) being estimated
in each case. In Figure 5, several contour plots are shown, where CO2 single-pass conver-
sion (XCO2,SP) (Figure 5a), the required feed excess (Figure 5b), the optimal temperature

the number of reactor modules. This was not only because the gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) decreased, but also because the optimal temperature had lower values (Figure 5c),
shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards higher methanol concentrations. In
contrast, reducing the purge fraction had little effect on XCO2,SP. This should be the result
of two competing effects: on one hand, a lower purge fraction means higher recycle
streams (Figure 5d), which increases the GHSV, reducing XCO2,SP. On the other hand, the
recycle stream has a H2:CO2 ratio greater than three due to a limited rWGSR extension.",0

procedure increased XCO2,SP and the latter maintained XCO2,SP roughly constant while
increasing the gas ﬂow inside the reactor modules.",0
278,"Since the reactants (H2, CO2) represent the highest costs of the plant, it is important to
minimize the required feed excess, which according to Figure 5b, occurred at 0.5% purge
fraction. However, with such a low purge fraction, the total recycle stream was considerably
high, demanding larger heat exchangers, ﬂash drums, and compressors, as well as higher
power consumption. Therefore, an intermediate value of 2% as the purge fraction was
selected for the detailed simulation in Aspen Plus, agreeing with other studies and typical
industrial values [22,39,58].",0

low (inlet: 4.95% mol/mol, outlet: 5.65% mol/mol). Due to the recycle streams, CO entered
the reactor modules at 1.50% mol/mol, although it was not a feedstock in the plant. CO was
produced through the rWGSR until the length of 1.5 m, where its concentration reached
3.3% mol/mol. Then, due to the high water concentration (4.30% mol/mol), the WGSR
became faster than its reverse reaction and started to consume CO, which exited the reactor
at 1.76% mol/mol and a marginal selectivity (0.5%). This virtually stabilized CO content in

In Figure 9, the concentration of the products along the length of the three reactors is

Reactor 1, CO entered at a low concentration (1.3% mol/mol), peaked at z = 2.5 m, and
left the reactor with a higher concentration (2.7% mol/mol). This CO production through

(21.8 vs. 17.6 MW). This occurred because power generation was signiﬁcantly lower in the

381,"In Figure 11a, the distribution of the equipment costs (EC) is presented, with the
reactor modules and the compressors representing the majority of the costs (>75%). The
total EC was 85.5 and 66.1 M€ for the one-step and the three-step approach, respectively.
This signiﬁcant improvement of the three-step process was a consequence of the inter-
mediate condensation steps, requiring a lower total reactor volume (due to an enhanced
reaction velocity), lower compressor size (due to a lower recycle ﬂow), and lower fur-
nace, turbine, and generator size (due to a lower purge ﬂow). The cost reduction in the
aforementioned equipment was signiﬁcantly higher than the additional costs of the heat
exchangers and ﬂash drums from the intermediate condensation units. The total ﬁxed
capital investment (FCI) was 415.9 and 321.4 M€ for the one-step and three-step approach,
respectively. The detailed estimated capacity and price of each equipment is presented in
the Supplementary Material (Section H).",0

383,"In Figure 11b, the distribution of the net production costs (NPC) is detailed. The main
operating costs were the reactant expenses (78–80% of NPC), with ACC contributing with
only 4–5%, while the catalysts and electricity consisted of less than 3% of the NPC. Due
to the higher overall CO2 conversion to methanol, the NPC of the three-step process was
5.7% lower than the one-step approach. The detailed OPEX costs are presented in the
Supplementary Material (Section H).
In Table 7, a summary of the overall costs is presented. The NPC was 920 and 868
€·ton−1 for the one-step and the three-step process, respectively, corresponding to an
improvement of 5.7% for the new process. Besides the hydrogen and carbon dioxide costs,
the ﬁxed capital investment (FCI) and the discount rate were the most sensitive parameters
to the methanol selling price, as shown in the tornado analysis (see Figure 12).",0

405,"A detailed study of a methanol synthesis plant from H2 and CO2 with intermediate con-
densation units (the three-step process) is presented and compared with the conventional
approach (the one-step process). The total production was ﬁxed at 1.16 Mton MeOH·a−1.
The processes were ﬁrst implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze the number
of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the reactor operating temperature. Using the
most suitable process parameters, detailed plants of both approaches were implemented
in Aspen Plus, including heat integration and a water Rankine cycle to make use of the
reaction enthalpy. Finally, techno-economic analyses were applied. Both processes offered
an excess of heat, which was used to generate electricity in our work, but could alternatively
supply other plants (e.g., CCU, OME synthesis) in a larger process integration.",0
406,"It was demonstrated that CO2 single-pass conversion almost doubled when including
intermediate condensation steps (53.9 vs. 28.5%), resulting in a signiﬁcantly higher overall
conversion to methanol (97.7 vs. 94.3%) and in a higher exergy efﬁciency (78.8 vs. 76.4%).
Because of the enhanced conversion, the new process required lower recycle and feed
streams, decreasing net production costs by 61.2 M€·a−1 (5.7%). Although additional
equipment (i.e., heat exchangers and gas–liquid separators) is necessary, the improved",0
407,"Processes 2022, 10, 1535",0
408,21 of 24,0
409,"process was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the conventional approach, requiring lower
sizes of the main equipment (e.g., compressors, reactors, ﬁred heater). Consequently,
according to our analysis, the total investment costs were 94.5 M€ (22.7%) lower than for
the conventional process.",0
410,"Intermediate condensation steps are therefore highly recommended for methanol
production from H2/CO2, reducing costs by improving CO2 equilibrium conversion to
methanol while using commercially proven technology. Besides, since water accelerates the
deactivation of Cu-based catalysts, product intermediate removal should increase catalyst
lifetime, as the average water concentration in the reactor is signiﬁcantly lower than in the
conventional process.
With our proposed process, the methanol net production costs amounted to 868 €·ton−1,
which are still signiﬁcantly higher than the current market price (495 €·ton−1) but is believed
to become economically viable with an effective reduction in the price of green hydrogen.",0
