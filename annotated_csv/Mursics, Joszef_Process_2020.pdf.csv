4,"Abstract: Waste gases that cannot be released into the environment are generated in chemical
industrial processes. There are various physico-chemical processes for the treatment of these gases,
but in most cases, they present a major cost to the company. There is an EU directive for each
industrial area describing the best available techniques (BAT) and the prescribed environmental limits
for the maximum discharge of dangerous substances into the environment. The current process for
the removal of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste industrial gases meets
EU environmental regulations. However, expected new EU directives will require a signiﬁcant
reduction in formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds’ concentrations in industrial exhaust
gases, thus necessitating a new technical solution for the removal of formaldehyde. This paper
describes two methods of removing formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from waste
gases, generated by the metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes. The ﬁrst method
involves upgrading existing processes of removing formaldehyde from waste gases with an additional
absorption plant, with which emissions can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The second method describes
the co-incineration of waste gases generated by a metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production
process with natural gas in a gas turbine, where formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds
are completely removed, while electricity is also produced. The second method is also useful for
removing various concentrations of volatile organic compounds from waste gases generated in
chemical industrial processes.",0

7,"Formalin, an aqueous solution of formaldehyde, is one of the most important base products in the
production of high-volume products in the chemical industry [1]. The amount of international trade of
formaldehyde today is less than 2% of the total volume of formaldehyde produced. The transport costs
for formaldehyde aqueous solutions are very high because of the relatively high proportion of water in
the product. Therefore, formaldehyde is usually used or processed at the site of production [2]. Taking
into consideration the constant increases in energy expenses in the production of such a high volume
of formaldehyde aqueous solutions, an optimal way of increasing eﬃciency is the use of by-product
energy, based on energy released in the process, and on oﬀ-gases from the production of formaldehyde
from methanol [3]. Energy management has become a very important branch of research in the
chemical process industry [4]. New developments include trends toward annual emission coupon
distribution aﬀects, limiting time-related components in decision making, and executing the transition
to processes based upon the latest technologies.",0

13,"•

14,"There are two basic production processes for formaldehyde:
The metal oxide catalyst process, operating with air surplus [5],
The silver catalyst process, operating with methanol surplus [6].
In the following sections, formaldehyde production plants using the two main process technologies
are described. This is the outcome of the development and investment in energetic process optimization,
including side streams of chemicals and energy, in various formaldehyde production plants over the
course of several years.",1
15,"At one site, PF (phenolic resin) and UF (urea resin) resins are manufactured, using the formaldehyde",1
16,produced and the excess steam from formaldehyde production.,1
17,2.1. Formaldehyde Production Using Metal Oxide Catalyst Processes,1
18,"During production with a metal oxide catalyst (molybdenum and iron oxide), formaldehyde is
formed by partial oxidation of methanol with oxygen [5]. The reactions take place on a metal oxide
catalyst in a reactor operating at a temperature of 250 to 500
C with a static layer of catalyst for
oxidation in the gas phase (ﬁxed-bed vapor-phase oxidation reactor) and a cooling system:",1

22,"To maintain the necessary oxidation atmosphere, the required ratio between methanol and air is
low; the methanol content is approximately 4 to 10 vol.%. This high surplus of air is possible because a
portion of the gas from the absorber is recycled, resulting in a suﬃcient reduction of oxygen to avoid
the formation of explosive mixtures. The overall process yield of formaldehyde from methanol is
90–92 mol percent. The thermal energy released during the reaction is discharged from the reactor
using thermal oil as a liquid medium for the energy transfer; the oil is then used for the production
of steam.",1
23,2.2. Formaldehyde Production Using Silver Catalyst Processes,1
24,"The ﬁrst industrial formaldehyde production processes used silver as catalyst [7]. This process
burdens the environment with gas emissions into the air, and with the generation of excess steam
condensate containing up to 0.2% of formaldehyde, which cannot be recycled into the process.",1
25,"The silver catalyst process partially converts methanol to formaldehyde with eﬃciency of up to
90%. The ternary mixture of formaldehyde/water/methanol must be separated via steam distillation.
Afterwards, the steam condensate is contaminated with formaldehyde (up to 0.2%), creating extra
costs for disposal or further treatment.",1
26,The synthesis is carried out using catalytic oxidation and dehydration of methanol in contact with,1
27,"a silver catalyst. Several reactions take place during the conversion process:

33,"Reaction (4) is exothermic. The thermal energy released in this reaction maintains the temperature
of the reactor and, at the same time, facilitates in reaction (3) the shift of the equilibrium to the right
side. This increases the formation of formaldehyde. Parallel to the main reactions (2)–(4), some side
reactions are carried out, reducing the eﬃciency of the process. The important side reactions are:",1

steam, and external electric energy is required for the methanol conversion process and the connected

45,3. Oﬀ-Gas Puriﬁcation Process,1
46,Oﬀ-gases with high levels of carbon monoxide and formaldehyde must not be discharged into,0
47,the environment.,0
48,"A computer simulation of the puriﬁcation of waste gases generated by the metal oxide catalyst
formaldehyde production processes was carried out with Aspen Plus software (Figure 1). The process
of puriﬁcation of waste gases from this process is exothermic and generates heat, which could be used
for steam production. Steam, which can be used in other processes or used for electricity production,
is generated in the puriﬁcation of the waste gases. The average production is approximately 21.6 t/hr
formaldehyde with 37% concentration. Table 1 shows the composition of waste oﬀ-gases (A) before
the puriﬁcation process and (B) after catalytic puriﬁcation of waste gases. The data in Table 1 were
obtained from gas chromatography measurements of existing metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde
production processes. These data are the bases of further research to improve the waste oﬀ-gases
cleaning process described in this article.",1
49,"The existing process for cleaning oﬀ-gases from metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production
processes consists of a heat exchanger (EXCH1) where the waste gases, having the composition given
in Table 1, are heated to the temperature necessary for the oxidation of organic substances present
in the ﬂue gases and go to reactor (REACTOR) ﬁlled with ceramic ﬁller. The hot gases with the
composition, given in Table 1, from the reactor are fed to heat exchanger (EXCH2) where steam is
produced. The cooled gases are then passed to a heat exchanger (EXCH1), thence, to a heat exchanger
(EXCH3), and then discharged through the chimney to the environment. The chemical composition of
the waste gases discharged into the environment is given in Table 1.",1

78,"The primary type of steam turbine is a condensing steam turbine, which is used for high-power
applications. The steam is discharged directly into one or more condensers that maintain vacuum
conditions. Condensing steam turbine processes produce the highest mechanical power and eﬃciency;
however, the output power of condensing steam turbines is sensitive to ambient temperature.
Condensing steam turbines are expensive, large, and complex.",0

applications. The term back-pressure refers to turbines that release steam at a pressure higher than
atmospheric pressure. Low pressures are often used in heating systems, while high pressures are often

pollution prevention and control), in particular, Article 13 (5) on Best Available Techniques (BAT),
constitutes the reference for setting permit conditions for installations referred to in Chapter II of
Directive 2010/75/EU [8]. Many studies have been done on formaldehyde emissions from diﬀerent
processes [9–11].The competent authorities of an EU Member State should set emission limit values to
ensure that, under normal operating conditions, emissions do not exceed the emission levels associated
with the best available techniques as speciﬁed in BAT; the levels for total volatile organic carbon (TVOC)

glycol solutions, where it forms diﬀerent adducts with the solvents. Formaldehyde absorption by
water is a mass-transfer process, complicated by a chemical reaction in the ﬂuid phase [13]. In general,

109,"Various models are proposed for describing the equilibrium of vapor-liquid in the formaldehyde
water system. The model shown in [15] assumes that the vapors above the aqueous formaldehyde
solution consist of three types: Water, formaldehyde monomers, and methylene glycol. These species
are also present in the liquid phase. However, ﬂuid with higher concentrations of formaldehyde
also contains higher polyoxymethylene glycols. It is assumed that the vapor phase behaves as a
mixture of ideal gases, but the chemical-reaction equilibrium for the formation of methylene glycol
from formaldehyde and water is taken into account with the constant of the balance of chemical
reactions [15].",0
110,"The liquid phase is treated as a real, chemically reactive mixture of aqueous formaldehyde
monomers, methylene glycols, and polyoxymethylene glycols at higher formaldehyde concentrations.
The chemical potential of the components in the liquid phase is normalized according to Raoult’s
law. The non-ideality of the liquid phase is taken into account, using the contribution method of the
UNIFAC (Functional-group Activity Coeﬃcients) group [19]. Chemical reaction equations are taken
into account with the true reaction equilibrium constants [14].",0

116,"The main characteristic of these changes was the assumption that chemical equilibrium can
be approximated with equivalent constants based on molar proportions, rather than on activities.
This assumption has caused a signiﬁcant reduction in computer time required, owing to the introduction
of certain thermodynamic inconsistencies. These inconsistencies are particularly evident when
the model is used to calculate azeotropic points. Given the lack of thermodynamic compliance,
the calculated maximum pressure on the isothermal pressure diagram and the concentration of the

223,"The waste gas treatment process described in Figure 1 is in accordance with existing EU directives
and suﬃciently reduces the concentration of formaldehyde in waste gases to comply with current
standards, but it still releases about 280 kg of formaldehyde per year. By purifying the waste gases with
water absorption, as shown in Figure 4, formaldehyde emission is reduced from 0.033 kg/h to about
0.0056 kg/h; about 0.027 kg/h formaldehyde is absorbed in water, which is then used as process water.
In order to completely remove formaldehyde from waste gases, which contain other combustible
organic substances, co-incineration with natural gas is recommended, with the resulting energy used
to generate electricity. Proposed new technological process for oﬀ-gases’ co-incineration from the
metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes reduces the levels of formaldehyde, carbon
monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to practically zero. The co-incineration
process would use the combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power system shown in Figure 5.",1

227,"A combined-cycle gas turbine power system consists of the following components: Gas turbine,
steam turbine, waste heat recovery units for steam generation, condenser, and other auxiliary
equipment [22]. A combined-cycle gas turbine power system typically uses a gas turbine to drive
an electrical generator and recovers waste heat from the turbine exhaust gas to generate steam,
which drives a steam turbine to provide supplemental electricity. The overall electrical eﬃciency of a
combined-cycle gas turbine power system is typically in the range of 50–60% [23].",1
228,"Figure 5 shows the co-combustion of waste gases in the metal oxide catalytic formaldehyde
production process; the waste gases (OFF-GAS) are mixed with air (AIR-IN) in a static mixer (MIX)
before going into the compressor (COMP). The lower explosion limit of the carbon monoxide/air
mixture is 12.5 vol.%, so no explosion will occur when compressing a very diluted oﬀ-gas/air mixture
in the gas turbine compressor.",1
229,"The gas turbine is comprised of a compressor (COMP), a combustion chamber (COMBUST),
which supplies natural gas (NAT-GAS) to the burners, and a turbine (TURB) that drives the generator.
The gas turbine emits ﬂue gases into heat recovery units for steam generation (ST-GENER), and the
steam then goes into the steam turbine (ST-TURB) to provide supplemental electricity.",1

The electricity required to operate the chemical process can be obtained from the electricity grid or
can be produced by our own production. The heat required for operation of the chemical process
could be produced or utilize the heat ﬂows of the production process through thermal integration.
When consuming electricity from the electricity grid, except for the cost of energy consumed, it is
necessary to pay the connection power, transport, distribution, CO2 emissions, and other taxes,
which diﬀer from one country to another.",0

consuming primary energy to produce electricity, there are no other taxes than CO2 tax. Of course,
it is necessary to take into account the investment costs in the power plant for electricity production.
Electricity generation for transmission to the electricity grid is not cost eﬀective due to the low purchase
price, except in the case of subsidies for the use of renewable sources or the combination of heat
and power.",0
378,"If the heat required for the operation of the chemical production process is taken from the CCGT
power plant, steam is withdrawn before entering the steam turbine. In this case, the power plant is
called CHP (Combined Heat and Power). Some countries promote CHP through subsidized energy
production, where electricity can be supplied to the electricity grid or consumed for its own production
process, which is also economically most favorable.",0

directives. Therefore, a study of possible new technical solutions was conducted to signiﬁcantly reduce
the concentration of formaldehyde and VOCs in the waste gases generated by the formaldehyde
production process with metal oxide.",0

390,"The ﬁrst proposed technical solution for the removal of formaldehyde and VOCs from waste
gases produced by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes (Figure 1) is an upgrade
of the existing process by the additional absorption of formaldehyde present in ﬂue gases in water
(Figure 2). In the computer simulation, the equilibrium absorption constants and reactions of low
concentrations of formaldehyde in water were taken into account.",0
391,"By describing an additional new process for absorbing low concentrations of formaldehyde from
waste gases (Figure 2) and comparing the data obtained with the measurements of the real production
process (Figure 1) given in Table 1 and the results of computer simulation given in [12], formaldehyde
emissions into the environment can be reduced by more than ﬁve times. The heat generated by the
process of removing formaldehyde and VOCs from waste gases produced by metal oxide catalyst
formaldehyde production processes (Figures 1 and 2) can be used to produce steam used for the
production process or to generate electricity.",0
392,"The second proposed technical solution in the conducted study is the co-combustion of waste
gases produced by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes with CCGT (Figure 5) or
CHP if the steam produced is used for heat production instead of electricity production. The results of a
computer simulation of co-incineration of waste gases generated by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde

formaldehyde and VOCs in the waste gases decreased to practically zero.",0
393,"In the performed research of the removal of formaldehyde and VOCs by co-incineration of waste
gases produced by metal oxide catalyst formaldehyde production processes with CCGT or CHP power
