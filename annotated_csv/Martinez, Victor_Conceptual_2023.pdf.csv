2,"Abstract: This work discusses the conceptual process design for the integrated production of bio-
based acrylic acid from carob pod aqueous extracts. CHEMCAD was used for the process simulation
and cost estimation of the relevant equipment. The process was designed for a capacity of 68 kt
of carob pod per year, operating 8000 h annually, and involving extraction, fermentation, catalytic
dehydration, and distillation to achieve 99.98%w/w acrylic acid as the main product. The economic
assessment for the base case suggests a ﬁxed capital investment of EUR 62.7 MM with an internal
rate of return of 15.8%. The results obtained show that carob pod is a promising biomass source for
the production of bio-acrylic acid.",0

8,1. Introduction,0
9,"The use of renewable sources with the aim of moving from a fossil-based economy to a
more sustainable economy based on biomass is the object of numerous research efforts and
policy developments to implement this transition [1–3]. The carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.)
is an evergreen tree typical of the Mediterranean region whose pod can be classiﬁed into two
parts, the kibble (locust bean), which represents between 80–90%w/w of the pod, and the
seeds or kernels (locust kernel gum), which account for 20–10%w/w of the pod. The kibble
is mainly used for livestock feeding, while the seeds are used to produce locust bean gum,
which in turn is very much appreciated by the food industry. The primary composition of
carob kibble consists of 32–42%w/w sucrose, 7–10%w/w glucose, 10–12%w/w fructose, and
minor amounts of amino acids, minerals, and phenolic compounds [4]. Despite that, carob
kibble has minimal commercial value for farmers, and its chemical composition makes it a
cheap carbon and nitrogen source to be used in fermentative processes for the production
of bio-based chemicals [5]. Among the different bio-based chemicals that can be produced
through fermentation processes, lactic acid (LA) is one of the primary platform chemicals
for the green chemistry of the future because it has both carboxylic and hydroxyl groups,
providing a high versatility to be used as a precursor of several valuable chemicals such as
acrylic acid (AA) [6,7]. AA is a bulk chemical that is used in the manufacture of plastics,
coatings, adhesives, elastomers, ﬂoor polishes, and paints which are mainly produced by
propylene oxidation. Around 6 million tons of AA are produced annually. The global
market for AA and its derivatives is expected to increase at an annual rate of 3.5% during
the 2020–2025 period; therefore, there is great interest in replacing the petrol-based AA
with a bio-based equivalent [8].",0
10,"Several studies have reported the production of AA from bio-based raw materials.
One example is the biological conversion of glycerol into 1,3 propanediol (1,3 PDO) and 3-
hydroxy propanoic acid (3HP) in anaerobic conditions followed by the aerobic fermentation",0

15,"of the mixture to oxidized 1,3 PDO into 3HP. Then, 3HP is catalytically dehydrated to
produce AA using TiO2 at 210 ◦C [9]. Other works have studied the direct production
of 3HP through the fermentation of sugars with genetically modiﬁed microorganisms
such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [10,11] for further catalytic dehydration.
However, the direct fermentation to produce 3HP is still in the early stage to be industrially
implemented. On the other hand, although LA is produced industrially via fermentation
at a concentration of around 10%w/v, the catalytic dehydration of its secondary hydroxyl
group has proven to be difﬁcult due to its resistance to hydrolysis. Recent efforts have
been devoted to the development of heterogeneous catalysts such as potassium modiﬁed
sodium zeolites, resulting in selectivity and conversion improvements [8,12–14]. This work
aims to evaluate the techno-economic assessment of a conceptual bioreﬁnery design to
produce AA from carob pod via LA dehydration.",0
16,"2. Methods
2.1. Process Description",1
17,"The process scheme was conceptually developed based on our laboratory experiments
and a thorough scientiﬁc literature review [15]. The conceptual process design was sim-
ulated in CHEMCAD7 for a capacity of 68 kt of carob pod per year by analogy with our
previous work [16]. The proposed process was assumed to operate 8000 h/year and it is
composed of the following sections: (i) carob pod storage, (ii) sugar extraction and solids
drying, (iii) fermentation, (iv) LA dehydration, and AA recovery.",1

19,"ST-101 in Figure 1 represents the carob pod storage section in contrast to the 2012
design, which assumed pile storage; in this case, a close system using concrete domes was
adopted according to the method proposed by Humbird et al. [17]. Cost estimation for our
system was calculated by applying Equation (1).",1

position was approximated with the data provided by Faik et al. [18] to obtain the
empirical chemical formula of C4.71O2.81H9.54N.

45,"Carob pulp size was decreased from 13 mm to an average size of 0.6 mm in a roller
crusher (C-101). After milling, sugars were extracted in two stirred tank reactors (EX-101
and EX-102) with water at room temperature at 700 r.p.m. using an S/L ratio of 0.15 in each
reactor to keep a sucrose concentration of 0.11 M at the entrance of R-201. The resulting
slurry after sugar extraction was introduced in a ﬁlter press to reduce the solid moisture
from 62% to 20%. After separation, solids were sent to a rotary dryer (D-101) to obtain a
livestock feed with 5% moisture.",1
46,2.1.2. Lactic Acid Fermentation Section,1
47,"The ﬂow diagram of the fermentation section can be seen in Figure 2. The extracted
sugars were sterilized in HX-101 by heating the stream up to 98 ◦C and then cooled down to
34 ◦C before going into the fermentation section. After sterilization, a ﬁxed bed enzymatic
reactor (R-201) was used to hydrolyse sucrose using an invertase load of 95 mg/L. The
modelling of this reactor was carried out using the kinetic data provided by the work
of Bowski et al. [20]. According to their study, for sucrose concentrations below 0.3 M,
the kinetic data can be adjusted to a mixed-order kinetic expression (see Supplementary
Information Section S1). Sucrose concentration at the inlet of R-201 is kept at 0.11 M
through recirculation of process water from T-202. A continuous fermentation process
with Lactobacillus casei was considered using a dilution rate of 0.5 h−1 at 37 ◦C. L. casei
are Gram-positive, non-sporulating, and strictly fermentative bacteria that produce LA
as the main metabolic end product. They can metabolize glucose and fructose but not
sucrose. Thus, the assumption of replacing fructose with glucose made in the simulation
was expected not to affect the ﬁnal result [21].",1

using two stoichiometric reactors (unit FX-201) to take into account the formation of new
cells whose empirical formula was considered to be CH2N0.25O0.5 [22]. According to
the work by Turhan et al. [23], a total glucose conversion of 97% was implemented (43%
accounted for cell growth and 54% for the conversion into LA). Reactions (2) and (3) were
used for the stoichiometric reactors:

solution in F-201. A total of 93% of the liquid outlet of F-201 was recycled back to the sugar
extraction section and the remaining 7% was used to adjust the concentration of lactic
below 50% before its dehydration. CaC6H10O6 was sent to unit N-201 where it was treated

301, which was used at the same time to generate low-pressure steam at 150 ◦C. The
cooled stream entered the absorption tower TW-301 to remove the light components.
Deionized water was used in TW-301 to minimize AA and acetaldehyde losses. The
liquid outlet of TW-301 was introduced into the distillation column TW-302 to obtain a
distillate rich in acetaldehyde with a 96.06%w/w purity. The liquid outlet of TW-302 was
introduced into the liquid–liquid extraction column TW-303, which used toluene as an
extraction agent following the recommendations given by Song et al. [24]. After liquid–
liquid extraction, the extracted phase moved to a separation train, which consisted of two
distillation columns (TW-304 and TW305) to separate each component with the required
commercial assay. Columns TW-304 and TW-305 worked under vacuum (0.16 atm) to keep
the system temperature below 90 ◦C to avoid AA polymerization. The bottoms of column
TW-304 rich in AA and LA moved to column TW-305 to obtain a distillate with 99.98%w/w
AA and a bottom product with 99.40%w/w LA. The TW-304 distillate containing toluene
and water traces was pressurized to 1 atm and recycled to the TW-302 extraction column.",1

case. The effect of operating hours per year in Figure 4a was studied to take into account
the seasonal availability of the biomass and/or potential interruptions in the supply. The
operating hours/year were changed from 3600 h/year to 8000 h/year. A minimum of
5172 h/year are required to achieve an IRR of 10%. Figure 4b shows the variation of
the internal rate of return with the feedstock price. IRR values higher than 10% can be
reached for prices below 0.24 EUR/kg. Regarding the acrylic selling price and utility costs,
Figure 4c,d show that a minimum selling price of 1.84 EUR/kg and a maximum utility cost
of 0.64 EUR/kg make the process proﬁtable.",0

360,"Based on the simulation results, the material and energy balances show that the process requires
8.5 t/h of carob pod to produce 2.42 t/h of acrylic acid with an overall energy consumption of
88.9 MJ/kg, which is comparable to the value of 53.2 MJ/kg reported by Bhagwat et al. [8].
The economic evaluation performed for the base case suggested that a plant operating 8000 h/year
with a treatment capacity of 8.5 t/h of carob pulp requires an FCI of EUR 62.7 MM with an IRR",0

366,"value of 15.8%. The effects of changing the operating hours, acrylic acid selling price, feedstock,
and utility costs on the economic performance of the plant were evaluated independently to
determine the ranges in which the IRR of the base case is higher than 10%.
It was concluded that the investment involved a minimum of 5172 h/year of operation, an
acrylic acid selling price higher than 1.84 EUR/kg, and carob pulp and utilities costs below
0.24 EUR/kg and 0.64 EUR/kg, respectively.
A factorial design of the experiments was carried out to evaluate the combined effect of the
economic variables selected on the IRR. The analysis of the standardized effect shows that the
order of the most signiﬁcant variables is carob pulp cost > acrylic acid selling price > utility
cost > operating hours. Using the analysis of the variance, a model equation showing the
relationship of the IRR with the economic variables selected was obtained. The maximum of
this function provides an (IRR)max of 16.91% for 8000 h of yearly operation, a feedstock price of
0.15 EUR/kg, an acrylic acid selling price of 2.20 EUR/kg, and a utility cost of 0.50 EUR/kg.",0
