12,"Abstract: Carbon capture and utilization is an attractive technique to mitigate the damage to the
environment. The aim of this study was to techno-economically investigate the hydrogenation
of CO2 to methanol and then conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether using Aspen Plus® (V.11,
Aspen Technology, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, USA). Hydrogen was obtained from alkaline
water electrolysis, proton exchange membrane and solid oxide electrolysis processes for methanol
production. The major cost contributing factor in the methanol production was the cost of hydrogen
production; therefore, the cost per ton of methanol was highest for alkaline water electrolysis and
lowest for solid oxide electrolysis. The speciﬁc cost of methanol for solid oxide electrolysis, proton
exchange membrane and alkaline water electrolysis was estimated to be 701 $/ton, 760 $/ton and
920 $/ton, respectively. Similarly, the speciﬁc cost of dimethyl ether was estimated to be 1141 $/ton,
1230 $/ton and 1471 $/ton, using solid oxide electrolysis, proton exchange membrane and alkaline
water electrolysis based hydrogen production, respectively. The cost for methanol and dimethyl ether
production by proton exchange membrane was slightly higher than for the solid oxide electrolysis
process. However, the proton exchange membrane operates at a lower temperature, consequently
leading to less operational issues.",0

15,"The issue of global warming is becoming a central focus of the research community.
Global warming is mainly triggered by industry, urbanization, deforestation and over-
population. The emission of CO2 is especially problematic, as it contributes around 80%
of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1] and its concentration in the environment
reached almost 420 ppm in 2021 [2].",0
16,"Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is an effective method for mitigation of CO2
levels. However, a major drawback of CCS is its economic penalty as it causes an increase
in cost of electricity of up to 45–70% [3] depending upon the type of power plant. Carbon
capture and utilization (CCU) is another approach to CO2 mitigation and shifting towards
‘clean and green energy’. In CCU, CO2 being released from some conventional power
plants is captured (and sometimes stored for a very short time) and then converted to some
useful products aligned to market demands. Sustainable CO2 utilization should recover the",0

CCU is an attractive option for CO2 mitigation. However, CO2 is a highly stable molecule,
and it may therefore be difﬁcult to convert it into some other product; a high energy input
is required for CCU processes. Recently, adsorbents along with suitable catalysts have
been used to capture CO2 and convert it to some useful products [4]. Other options for
CO2 mitigation include improving the efﬁciency of already existing systems [5], e.g., co-
generation along with CO2 capture [6–8], switching towards ‘clean and green fuels’ [9] and
use of low quality or waste energy [10].",0
27,"Possibilities for CO2 utilization may be divided into physical and chemical utiliza-
tion. Physical utilization of CO2 includes its utilization in enhanced oil recovery (EOR),
enhanced gas recovery (EGR), etc. [11]. In chemical utilization, the CO2 molecule loses its
original identity and is converted to some other product. However, it may be emitted after
utilization of the other product or some part of it, depending on the end use of the product.
The chemical utilization of CO2 involves its conversion into syngas, methanol, sugar, acetic
acid, ethanol, dimethyl ether (DME), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), carbamates, etc. [12]. The
world is shifting from conventional fossil fuel consumption to alternative fuels to conserve
natural resources and deal with global warming issues. The focus of CCU techniques is the
conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels, which is termed as ‘Power to Liquid’ (PtL).",0
28,"Methanol is one of the most useful products of PtL since it can be used as a substitute
for gasoline. It is also used as a feedstock for DME, DMC, and acetic acid. Methanol is
used as a solvent in many industries [13]. Traditionally, methanol is produced using syngas
in the presence of Cu as catalyst [14]. Another method of methanol production is by CO2
hydrogenation employing Cu and Zn based catalysts [15]. Methanol can be produced
from CO2 and hydrogen in two ways. It can be formed by direct hydrogenation of CO2 as
presented by Equation (1) or by a reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) in which CO is
ﬁrst produced, as in Equation (2), and then methanol is produced by reaction presented in
Equation (3) [16].",0

35,"Van-Dal et al. [17] simulated and analyzed the production of fuels including gasoline,
methanol, and mixed alcohols by hydrogenation of CO2. Lonis et al. [18] identiﬁed that
the major cost component is the cost of hydrogen production using water electrolysis tech-
niques. Yousaf et al. [19] carried out the techno-economic analysis of integrated hydrogen
(by solid oxide electrolyzer (SOE) steam electrolysis process) and methanol production
process (by hydrogenation of CO2) using Aspen Plus®. Use of the SOE resulted into a 22.3%
reduction of the cost of hydrogen as cosoimpared to alkaline water electrolysis (AEL). This
reduction in hydrogen cost along with conﬁguration improvement and parametric analysis
resulted into a methanol production cost of $701.5/ton which was less than AEL based on
a previous study ($1063/ton) [19]. However, further advances are required to match the
current market price of methanol.",0
36,"Production of dimethyl ether (DME) is another attractive option for PtL processes.
DME is produced by the dehydration of methanol or is directly produced from synthesis
gas. Conventional processes such as the gasiﬁcation of coal, oil and natural gas emit CO2
and syngas. The syngas is then converted to methanol and further to DME. Since in this
study methanol is produced by the hydrogenation of CO2, therefore the dehydration of
methanol is adopted for DME production in the current work. Due to recent environmental
issues, DME has gained much more attention as an alternative fuel for diesel, propane
and liqueﬁed petroleum gas in the automobile industry [20]. It is also used for power
generation and it is an efﬁcient fuel since it has a high cetane number of 55–60 [21]. DME is
considered a ‘clean fuel’ since it has no sulfur and nitrous oxide emissions.",0

39,"Hassan Babiker et al. [22] simulated the DME production by dehydration of methanol
in Aspen HYSYS®. It was found that more than 80% overall conversion of methanol into
DME can be achieved at a temperature range of 200–400 ◦C. Michael et al. [23] simulated
the dehydration of methanol for DME production using a nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL)
property package. The methanol dehydration took place in the reactor producing water
and DME, as presented by Equation (4). The purity of DME was 99%. It was mentioned
that methanol and DME consume CO2 and reduce the GHGs emissions by 82–86% since
no sulfur and nitrogen contents are involved in their combustion. It was also reported that
utilizing these fuels can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by 82–91% [23].",0

42,"Hydrogen must be produced by some ‘clean and green source’ since the aim of this
study is the mitigation of CO2 emissions. Hydrogen is mainly produced by conventional
and renewable techniques. Several methods of hydrogen production are shown in Figure 1.
Hydrogen produced by conventional processes utilizes fossil fuel energy in terms of coal,
oil, and natural gas, and consequently emits huge amounts of CO2. The second method
involves the utilization of renewable energy (RE) for hydrogen production [24]. The water
electrolysis process for hydrogen production uses RE. The main challenge in the production
of hydrogen by water electrolysis is the economics of the process.",0
43,Figure 1. Hydrogen production methods.,0
44,"The electrolysis of water needs energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.
Energy is supplied to water in terms of thermal and electrical energy. Worldwide, electroly-
sis of water contributes only a 4% share of total hydrogen production while the remainder
of hydrogen production still relies on conventional sources [25]. The contribution of water
electrolysis is less due to its high production cost for hydrogen compared to conventional
sources. The main challenges in water electrolysis include maintenance, minimization of
energy consumption, increasing durability and safety [26]. The hydrogen produced by
water electrolysis techniques is highly pure and can directly be supplied for utilization in
some cases [27]. The purity of the hydrogen gas produced depends upon the nature of the
electrolysis technique used. In this work, hydrogen is produced using water electrolysis
techniques and then used as a feed stock for methanol production utilizing captured CO2.
The methanol produced using hydrogen from water electrolysis is ﬁnally converted into
DME by a dehydration reaction.",0
45,"The most well-known green hydrogen production technologies based on water elec-
trolysis are alkaline water electrolysis (AEL), proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid
oxide electrolyzer (SOE) [14]. AEL and PEM are low temperature technologies, while SOE is
a high temperature method for producing hydrogen from water electrolysis. AEL and PEM
have an operating temperature range of 60–95 ◦C while SOE operates at around 800 ◦C.
AEL and PEM are mature technologies compared to SOE. The main challenge associated",0

48,AEL is the most mature technique for hydrogen production.,0
49,"with SOE is the selection of material, but this technology seems to have future potential
due to its improved economic feasibility [27]. The major difference in these processes lies
in terms of thermodynamics since the operating temperature of SOE is high as compared
to AEL and PEM so it requires less use of electricity. In past few years, hydrogen as a fuel
has been revolutionized due to its negligible emissions and its production from REs [26].
It uses an alkaline
solution (35% KOH) as the electrolyte and electricity is supplied for the electrolysis. The
water electrolysis reaction occurs in the stack to produce gaseous hydrogen and oxygen.
Hydrogen is produced at the cathode while oxygen is produced at the anode. The reversible
cell potential is determined through the Nernst equation, which predicts the minimum
electrical potential required for the electrolysis of water at a particular location in the cell
with a speciﬁc temperature and gas concentration. The Nernst voltage is calculated using
the Gibbs free energy by the following relation.",0

represents the thermal energy demand. If the thermal energy is supplied to the system,
the electrical energy requirements will decrease; i.e., if the electrolysis occurs at high
temperature as in SOE, the total electricity requirement is reduced [19]. The actual voltage
required for the cell is greater than the reversible voltage due to the irreversibility in
the system [27].",0
57,"Jingang et al. [28] reported that among hydrogen production methods including biogas
steam reforming, ﬂuidized bed biomass steam gasiﬁcation and AEL, AEL has highest
efﬁciency (i.e., 66%). The investment cost of AEL is less compared to other technologies
but operating cost is high. Schmidt et al. [29] compared AEL, SOE and PEM based on the
different operating conditions, costs and life-cycles. The comparison was based on previous
literature. It was reported that the capital cost of AEL was the least while that for SOE
was greatest. In another study, Christian et al. [25] reported AEL to be an environmentally
friendly technique if the source is REs while AEL presented maximum environmental
impact if coal was used for power production instead of REs. Sanchez et. el [30] made an
experimental setup for AEL as well as simulating the AEL process. It was reported that the
stack of AEL consumed 92% of the power and the stack power was the highest contributing
factor in the overall cost of AEL.",0
58,"PEM is termed as ‘polymer exchange membrane’ since it is made of polymeric mem-
branes as electrolyte. In PEM, the membrane lies between the electrodes [28]. PEM is a
mature technique and has gained much attention in the previous years due to its high
performance. The hydrogen produced using this technology is clean since it has no CO2 or
other GHGs emission, if a carbon free source of electricity is used. The membrane of PEM
operates at a temperature of almost 70–80 ◦C [28]. PEM uses a relatively thin membrane.
The membrane splits the water and, since it is proton conducting, it only allows the proton
or hydrogen ions to pass through [29]. The investment cost of PEM is high as highly
expensive materials such as platinum, titanium and iridium are used [31]. The thickness
of PEM is only 0.2 mm [32]. The membranes of PEM must have high ionic conductivity,
excellent chemical stability, mechanical strength and be relatively less expensive [28]. The
electrolysis of water demands a higher voltage, while PEM has typical cell voltages ranging
from 1.5 V to 2 V [31].",0

61,"Julio et al. [33] reported that although the investment cost of PEM is high compared to
other technologies, it can operate with high efﬁciency in MW ranges, unlike AEL which
usually operates in kW ranges. Ibrahim et al. [34] mentioned that Naﬁon® has excellent
properties and chemical stability. The main challenge is to maintain the humidiﬁcation
level inside the membranes which may deteriorate the membrane if it is not sufﬁcient, and
the chemical degradation of membrane might occur. A comparison was made between
different membranes used for PEM such as Naﬁon® (Solution Technology Inc., Mendenhall,
PA), organic and inorganic membranes and non-ﬂuorinated membranes. It was reported
that Naﬁon® membranes with ﬁllers were the best.",0
62,"Methanol and DME are among the best fossil fuel alternatives for the abatement of
CO2 considering the global concerns over GHG emissions. Lonis et al. [18] simulated the
production of methanol using both AEL and SOE based hydrogen production processes
in Aspen Plus®. The efﬁciency of the AEL based process was less as compared to the
SOE based process, since AEL required more power. Moreover, it was also reported that
the capital cost of SOE was higher than AEL. Hydrogen production using different water
electrolysis methods is considered clean, if a carbon free energy source is used. However,
mostly experimental work is done on water electrolysis techniques and very limited sim-
ulation work is available on their detailed thermodynamic and economic performance.
These water electrolysis techniques are usually compared based on experimental results in
terms of capital cost and operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, voltages and
current densities. Detailed thermodynamic and economic analysis of the water electrolyzed
hydrogen production processes is required to evaluate and compare the performance using
different hydrogen production methods.",0
63,"This study has some signiﬁcant features such as attempting to cover the research gap by
presenting different routes for DME and methanol production from CO2 and hydrogen. In
this study, hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was integrated with a methanol dehydration
plant for DME production. Instead of conventional processes of hydrogen production such
as steam methane reforming, coal gasiﬁcation and oil reforming that release CO2 into the
environment, the hydrogen used is produced by clean technology, i.e., water electrolysis
that utilizes REs to disassociate water molecules. The CO2 captured from a cement plant
was used for hydrogenation to methanol. This process has two advantages, ﬁrstly it utilizes
the captured CO2 that would be otherwise released into the environment and, secondly,
hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis instead of conventional processes; hence, this
process prevents the further release of CO2 into the environment. The methanol and DME
can be used as gasoline substitutes; less hazardous emissions are expected from methanol
and DME because they do not have nitrogen and sulfur compounds associated with them
as compared to conventional fuels. Hence, the environment can be saved from further
emissions of CO2 and pollution to some extent, by implementing this technique.",0
64,"In this work, an integrated process is proposed to produce methanol and DME by
using hydrogen from water electrolysis and CO2 from a post-combustion capture plant.
The schematic of the proposed integrated process is presented in Figure 2. Simulations of
the CO2 capture process are not performed in this study since extensive data are available
on it. The captured CO2 from a cement plant was used in this study. The captured CO2 was
compressed and sent to methanol production. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water,
i.e., AEL, PEM or SOE was fed to the compression unit. The energy for compressors was
provided externally. The compressed hydrogen was then fed to the methanol production
unit. The amount of hydrogen produced by each water electrolysis process was the same.
The thermo-economic comparison of methanol and DME integrated processes employing
three different hydrogen production processes was performed in this work. The simulation
ﬂow sheets and the results of the SOE method for hydrogen production were taken from
the work of Yousaf et al. [19]. This work is the extension of the published results of Yousaf
et al. [19], where methanol production is simulated using hydrogen from SOE. In the already
published results of Yousaf et al. [18], hydrogen produced by SOE was integrated with
methanol production. However, the temperature of SOE is almost 800◦C for electrolysis",0
65,"Resources 2022, 11, 85",0

67,"and the materials needed for SOE operation are still under research as they need to tolerate
a high temperature. In the present study, the low temperature technologies (below 100 ◦C)
such as AEL and PEM are used for simulation of hydrogen production. The AEL and PEM
water electrolysis processes were modelled and integrated with the methanol production
process to assess the technological and economic impacts of these processes on methanol
production. The methanol ﬂowsheet is used with some slight modiﬁcation in the feed
stream of hydrogen and then methanol was converted into DME to assess another PtL
process for CO2 mitigation. Process ﬂow sheets for hydrogen production were simulated
using Aspen Plus® V11. The economic analysis was carried out using model equations and
the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer® V11 (APEA).",0

69,"In this work, water electrolyzed hydrogen production techniques, i.e., AEL and PEM,
were simulated in Aspen Plus® and compared with the SOE [19]. The simulated water
electrolyzed processes were compared to verify their economic feasibility in terms of
total annual cost (TAC), power and cost per ton of hydrogen. The hydrogen production
methods integrated with methanol production are compared in terms of TAC, cost per ton
of methanol and cost per ton of methanol after selling oxygen. The methanol produced by
the water electrolysis process is converted to DME and the cost per ton of DME is evaluated.
The net emissions of CO2 by each integrated process are also assessed. The comparison
shows that the cost for hydrogen production by AEL is the highest, and by SOE is lowest.
Similarly, the cost of methanol and DME production is highest for AEL, and lowest for SOE.
PEM has the highest power consumption among these three techniques, which may lead to
high net emissions of CO2 if non-renewal energy is used.",0

the same way, 1% by weight of stream 5 from the hydrogen section (i.e., stream 7) is sent to
the oxygen section to react with oxygen and produce water to recycle that for electrolysis.
The stream from the mixer (M3) enters a separator (S2) to separate the water from oxygen.
The recovered water is recycled for electrolysis in mixer (M1). In S3, water is removed from",1

stream from the bottom of separator (S3) is hydrogen and oxygen. This stream again enters
the separator (S4) to separate hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen gas is removed from the
bottom of separator (S4) while hydrogen gas removed from the top enters the compressor
(C1) to compress the hydrogen. The hydrogen produced by PEM is sent to the methanol

shown in Figure 5. Demineralized water was pressurized to 2 bar in the pump (P1) and was
preheated to 800 ◦C in a series of six heat exchangers (HX1, HX2, HX3, HX4, HX5 and HX6)
to produce superheated steam. In HX1, HX2 and HX3 heat from compressors intercooling
was used to preheat the water. Oxygen and hydrogen leaving the SOE were used as a
heating source in HX4 and HX5, respectively. Finally, high pressure steam was employed
as the heating utility in HX6 to meet the operating requirements. A further description of
SOE based hydrogen production can be seen from the previous work [19].",1
125,2.2. Case—II: Methanol Production Processes,1
126,"The methanol production process has three sub-categories i.e., AEL-Methanol, PEM-
Methanol and SOE-Methanol production processes, as shown in Table 1. The methanol
ﬂowsheet is taken from the previous work of Yousaf et al. [19]. The only difference in these
three sub-categories is in the production of hydrogen i.e., AEL, PEM and SOE. The ﬁnalized
ﬂow sheets for AEL and PEM based hydrogen production are given in Appendix A. A brief
description of the methanol production process is included in this section.
CO2 (at 2 bar and 28 ◦C) was compressed to 78 bar, while hydrogen was fed at 78 bar
and 184 ◦C for AEL and 78 bar and 129 ◦C for PEM (see Figure 6), while hydrogen was fed
at 78 bar and 192 ◦C for SOE [19]. The feedstock for methanol was mixed with the recycled
stream and was heated in HX14 using the heat from reactor outlet stream and fed to the
ﬁxed bed adiabatic reactor packed with commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. The crude
methanol stream exiting from the reactor at a high temperature can be used for heating, so
is divided into two streams. The divided streams after preheating were mixed, cooled to
35 ◦C and fed to a series of ﬂash tanks to remove untreated gases from the water-methanol
mixture. The liquid stream leaving the ﬁrst ﬂash tank was at a high pressure of 73 bar, so
expanded to 1.2 bar in two valves. A small portion (about 1%) of the untreated gases was
purged to the atmosphere to reduce the accumulation of inert gases in the system, and the
remaining 99% unreacted gases were compressed to 78 bar and recycled back. The crude
methanol leaving the second ﬂash tank was heated and sent to the distillation column to
separate the methanol and water. The water withdrawn from the bottom of the column
at 102 ◦C (stream 60) with a ﬂow rate of almost 35,000 kg/hr can be used as a waste heat
recovery in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The refrigerant R-245fa is used with a ﬂow",1

the methanol plant is more than 99% while less than 1% are impurities such as water
and unreacted gases, which are separated from the methanol. Pure methanol at 1 bar
and 40 ◦C is sent to the DME plant. The feed passes through pump (P1) which imparts a
pressure of 15 bar to achieve the conditions for the methanol dehydration reaction. The
pressurized methanol (stream 1) enters the mixer (M1) where it is mixed with the recycle
stream (RECYCLE) of methanol at 137 ◦C and 15 bar. The mixed (stream 2) at 15 bar and
64 ◦C enters the heat exchanger (HE1) where it is preheated to 250 ◦C by the product stream
(stream 4) coming from the reactor. The heated feed stream (stream 3) enters the reactor
(R1) where the dehydration reaction of methanol occurs, producing water and DME, as
presented by Equation (13). The temperature of the dehydration reaction is 350 ◦C and
pressure is 15 bar. The overall conversion of methanol to DME is 80% in the reactor. The
exiting stream from the reactor is 40% water, 19% methanol and 39% DME. The product
stream (stream 4), being at a high temperature of 350 ◦C, is used to pre-heat the feed stream
in a heat exchanger (HE1). The product stream (stream 5) after pre-heating the feed stream
exits the heat exchanger at 14 bar and 150 ◦C. This stream is cooled in the cooler to a
temperature of 90 ◦C before entering a distillation column (DTC1) to purify the DME. The
ﬁrst distillation column (DTC1), having 22 stages, recovers the DME. Pure DME (99.99%) is
removed from the top of the ﬁrst column at a temperature and pressure of 61 ◦C and 15 bar,
respectively. The bottom product (stream 7) of the DTC1, i.e., 67% water and 33% methanol
is sent to the second distillation column (DTC2) to separate the water and methanol. The
DTC2 has 15 stages and methanol is removed from the top (stream recycle) at 137 ◦C
and 10 bar with a purity of 95%. This methanol is recycled back in the Mixer (M1) while
the water removed from the bottom of DTC2 is at 180 ◦C and 10 bar. This water having
some traces of methanol and DME is sent to the wastewater treatment plant to recover
pure water.",1

dated with literature. A comparison based thermo-economic analysis of water electrolysis
methods (i.e., Case I) along with integrated methanol (i.e., Case II) and DME production

considered an economically infeasible process due to the high cost associated with hydro-
gen production. Some modiﬁcations were made in the published results from previous
work of Yousaf et al. [19] when AEL and PEM were integrated with methanol production.
The AEL and PEM integrated methanol processes were compared with SOE integrated

200,"Both AEL and PEM processes were simulated in Aspen Plus®. The results of these
processes were validated against the published results using the same input parameters.
The model results of AEL were compared with the model of Francesco et al. [18]. The input
parameters for validating the AEL model were taken from Francesco et al. [18], i.e., the
ﬂowrate of inlet water (675 kg/hr at 25 ◦C), concentration of KOH (35%), temperature
and pressure of the electrolysis process (75 ◦C and 25 bar) and the discharge pressure
of the pump (25 bar). Zaccarra et al. [32] also simulated SOE and PEM in Aspen Plus®
and then integrated these hydrogen production processes with methanol production.
The model of PEM was developed based on the concept of Zaccarra et al. [32]. The
results of the simulations in the current work for PEM are compared with the results of
Zaccarra et al. [32] and presented in Table 3. The input parameters for PEM validation were
taken from the published results of Zaccarra et al. [32], i.e., the ﬂowrate of inlet water stream
(97.8 kg/s), temperature and pressure of process (80 ◦C and 25 bar), the thickness of
membrane (0.2 mm) and the operating conditions of equipment. Validation of the SOE

227,"Reasonable agreement can be seen between the current work and literature values as
shown in Table 3 The maximum error for the AEL process is in the electronic efﬁciency
which is 2.7%. This deviation may be due to the use of stack developed in ACM; the
simulations in this work are done in Aspen Plus®, as these tools employ different models.
Instead of the stack, a combination of reactor and separator is used for the electrolysis. The
maximum deviation for the PEM process is in the power required, which is 3.8%. This
difference may be due to the slight amount of H2, i.e., 2% hydrogen that goes with oxygen.
To recover this 2% H2, additional equipment would need to be installed which increases
the overall cost of the plant and is not economically feasible [32]. Hence, the loss of 2% H2
in the current simulation is not recovered. The power required may be due to the greater
product purity required in this work, since pure H2 product is being removed that is free
from H2O and O2.",0

in PEM additionally contributes to the overall cost. The cost of Naﬁon® is $176/kg and
the life of the Naﬁon® membrane is almost 11 years. The key performance parameters for

water required by each process was slightly different. The amount of hydrogen and oxygen
produced through AEL, PEM and SOE was almost the same. The capital cost of the SOE
was the highest since it uses a series of compressors and heat exchangers which increases
its investment costs. The cost of utilities (cooling) was also greatest for SOE since several
compressors intercooling is required which increases the utility cost. AOC is highest for
AEL since the AEL uses additional raw material with water, i.e., KOH for electrolysis unlike
SOE and PEM which only use water as a raw material. Stack area was greatest for AEL and

265,"The key performance parameters including power required, TAC and cost per ton
of hydrogen are also presented in Figure 8 The power requirement was 416 MW for SOE,
590 MW for AEL and 642 MW for PEM. The power requirement was highest for PEM
and lowest for SOE. The highest power is required by PEM due to the use of membranes.
In PEM, the membrane thickness is very low, i.e., 0.2 mm, to ensure the proximity of
the electrodes. As the thickness decreases, the ﬂux across membranes increases and the
resistance inside the membrane decreases. Since current and resistance are inversely
related, when decreasing the resistance, the required current increases which increases
the total power required. The minimum power is required by SOE since it operates at a
high temperature of 800 ◦C; as the thermal energy increases the electrical energy demand
decreases. TAC is highest for AEL and lowest for SOE. The cost per ton of hydrogen ($/ton)
is highest for AEL (i.e., $4662/ton) and lowest for SOE (i.e., $3635/ton). The cost per ton
of hydrogen by PEM is slightly higher than that for SOE as shown in Figure 8 It should

331,"Figure 9 shows the comparison of three hydrogen production processes integrated
with methanol production process. The TAC is highest for the AEL-methanol integrated
process since it has high operating costs due to supplementary raw material used in the AEL
process i.e., KOH. Although the capital cost of SOE is high due to a series of compressors
and intercoolers, it operates at a high temperature of about 800 ◦C and requires less power
which reduces the cost of electricity and ultimately the TAC is lowest for the SOE-methanol
integrated process. The cost per ton of methanol is highest for AEL and lowest for SOE.
AEL entails the highest expenses compared to SOE and PEM due to its high TAC. The
cost per ton of methanol using AEL is compared with that mentioned in the literature [29].
i.e., $960/ton. The net cost per ton of methanol ($/ton) is calculated by subtracting the
income from selling the oxygen produced by water electrolysis. The economic comparison
shows that the SOE-integrated process for methanol production is economical compared
to the other two processes. However, it can be concluded that PEM-integrated methanol
production process can also be a good option in comparison to SOE-integrated methanol
production process as it is a mature technique and selection of material or its stability is not
major issue as compared to other options.
An ORC is employed to extract waste energy from the hot water stream, totalling
35,000 kg/hr at 102 ◦C (stream 60 in Figure 6.). The efﬁciency of the ORC is small (10%)
as the source temperature is low. Electricity produced by ORC is only 24 kW which
is negligible compared to the power requirements of AEL and PEM, i.e., 590 MW and
642 MW, respectively. This energy produced by ORC will contribute less than 0.005% in
the electrolysis process and, therefore, this ORC energy is not used in these simulations.",0

336,"DME is produced from methanol coming from the methanol production plant. Three
integrated processes for the production of DME have been simulated including AEL-
Methanol-DME, PEM-Methanol-DME and SOE-Methanol-DME. Each integrated process is
capable of yielding the same amount of DME, i.e., 430,000 ton/yr. As the raw material for
DME is methanol, the cost of methanol varies based on the type of electrolysis technique
used. The cost of methanol produced by conventional processes ($542/ton) is much less
than from the electrolysis process, i.e., $701/ton for SOE [19], 760 $/ton for PEM and
$920/ton for AEL.",0
337,"The economic analysis for three different DME processes (i.e., AEL-methanol-DME,
PEM-methanol-DME, SOE-methanol-DME) is presented in Table 6. The input parameters
for the DME process are the same for all cases as the same methanol feed is being used
and the only difference is in the techniques for the production of hydrogen. If DME is
produced using the methanol produced by some conventional processes that has CO2
emissions, the market cost of DME is at a minimum, i.e., $888/ton. For electrolysis process,
AOC, TAC and cost per ton of DME are lowest for the SOE-Methanol-DME integrated
process and highest for the AEL-Methanol-DME integrated process. However, AOC, TAC
and cost per ton of DME for the PEM-Methanol-DME integrated process are around 8%
higher than for the SOE-Methanol-DME integrated process. AOC, TAC and cost per ton
of DME for AEL-Methanol-DME integrated process are around 30% higher than for the
SOE-Methanol-DME integrated process. Cost per ton of DME is compared with the cost
for a conventional process in Figure 10 Cost per ton of DME for SOE-Methanol-DME,
PEM-Methanol-DME and AEL-Methanol-DEM is 28.5%, 38.5% and 65.6% higher than
the cost per ton for a conventional process, respectively. The costs per ton of methanol
and DME after selling oxygen for SOE-Methanol-DME, PEM-Methanol-DME and AEL-
Methanol-DEM are calculated by deducting the market price of oxygen, i.e., $1004/ton
DME, $1093/ton DME and $1332/ton DME, respectively. The detailed economics of the

fossil fuel-based electricity sources should be avoided to maintain the sustainability of the
process. Using renewable (e.g., wind, hydro, biomass and solar) and nuclear energy sources,
the net CO2 was consumed. Among the REs, solar energy has the highest consumption",0

385,"of CO2 while the consumption of CO2 is almost the same using wind, hydro and nuclear
energy in AEL, PEM and SOE.",0
386,"The conventional process of methanol production i.e., steam methane reforming
(SMR), emits 1.835 tons of CO2 for one ton of methanol production [43]. The market price
of methanol from conventional SMR processes is $539/ton, where the cost of methanol
by AEL-Methanol process is $920/ton and by the PEM-Methanol process is 760 $/ton.
Referring to Figure 11., the highest CO2 utilization using REs, as solar energy, is 0.79 and
0.86 tons of CO2/ton of methanol for AEL and PEM, respectively. However, the methanol
produced by the AEL process saves almost 2.6 tons of CO2 per ton of methanol, since
1.8 tons of CO2/ton of methanol emission are saved resulting from the SMR process in
addition to 0.79 tons of CO2/ton of methanol saved from CO2 consumption by AEL based
methanol production; this corresponds to additional expenses of $145/ton of CO2 mitigated
from environment. The PEM methanol production avoids emissions of almost 2.7 tons of
CO2/ton of methanol (1.8 tons of CO2/ton of methanol emission saved from SMR process
and 0.86 tons of CO2/ton of methanol saved from PEM) with a supplementary charge of
$82/ton of CO2 mitigated from the environment. For SOE, the total CO2 avoided per ton
of methanol production was evaluated to be over 3.0 ton. This corresponds to around $57
additional expenses per ton of CO2 mitigated from the environment [19]. These expenses
can be minimized by utilization of an economical source of energy to implement these
processes on commercial scale since the cost of water electrolysis (i.e., electricity source)
imposes a major cost burden in the overall methanol production process.",0
387,"In Figure 12 the net CO2 consumption for AEL-Methanol-DME, PEM-Methanol-DME
and SOE-Methanol-DME integrated processes is calculated using Equation (18). Here, the
net consumptions are higher as compared to Figure 11. In DME integrated processes, the
additional factor in the overall CO2 consumption calculation is the utility utilization in the
DME production process. Biomass, hydro, nuclear and wind sources have almost same
consumption of CO2 consumption while the highest consumption is for solar energy.",0
388,"The SOE-Methanol-DME integrated process would have saved emissions of 2.9 tons
of CO2/ton of DME if the SMR process was used and an additional 1.7 tons of CO2/ton of
DME are utilized, which would result in saving a total of 4.7 tons of CO2/ton of DME; the
cost of CO2 avoided is $68/ton of CO2. The AEL-Methanol-DME integrated process has
a cost of CO2 avoided of $139/ton of CO2 since 2.6 tons of CO2/ton of DME were saved
in addition to 2 tons of CO2/ton of DME resulting from solar energy; it thus saved a total
of a4.6 tons of CO2/ton of DME. In the same way, PEM-Methanol-DME has a cost of CO2
mitigation of $78/ton of CO2 since it avoids producing a total 5.2 tons of CO2/ton of DME.
The total carbon balance for both methanol and DME integrated processes is shown in
Table 7 with total CO2 consumption, CO2 avoided, and cost of CO2 mitigated, i.e., $/CO2
avoided or mitigated. The values are mentioned for RE, i.e., solar energy in this case, since

423,5. Conclusions,0
424,"The simulation results demonstrate that methanol production by hydrogenation of
CO2 along with dehydration of methanol to DME has the potential to mitigate CO2 emis-
sions. The technique also responds to the issues of GHGs emissions and global warming.
The production of DME and methanol would not only reduce the consumption of fossil
fuels but also provide feedstock for various chemicals. However, currently these processes
are economically infeasible owing to the high cost associated with hydrogen production
using water electrolysis techniques. The cost of hydrogen production by water electrolysis
techniques must be reduced and still further improvements are required for commer-
cial implementation of these processes. If the utility services for methanol and DME are
supplied by RE sources instead of conventional processes, the net CO2 emissions would
decrease. The cost per ton of methanol is $920/ton for AEL, $760/ton and $701/ton using
PEM and SOE, respectively. The cost for methanol is highest using AEL and lowest using
SOE. However, this cost is still signiﬁcantly higher than the market price of methanol, i.e.,
539 $/ton [38]. This study reports that in the methanol production process, the major cost
burden is the hydrogen production. Hydrogen production by SOE required 416 MW of elec-
trical energy, signiﬁcantly lower than that required by AEL (590 MW) and PEM (652 MW).
The cost per ton of DME using SOE-Methanol-DME production, PEM-Methanol-DME
production and AEL-Methanol-DME production is $1141/ton, $1230/ton and $1471/ton,
respectively. The SOE-Methanol-DME production process has the lowest cost for DME but
is still 30% higher than the market price of DME, i.e., $888/ton.",0
425,"It is clear from the above discussions that methanol and DME production can mitigate
CO2 emissions. Methanol and DME production from CO2 can provide environmentally
neutral fuels to power future vehicles. However, these processes can be implemented on
a commercial scale if the costs of hydrogen production, notably water electrolysis, are
further reduced. Since hydrogen production methods such as AEL, SOE and PEM have an
electricity cost of 70 €/MWh [15], if the cost of electricity is reduced or electricity is provided
at some discounted rate for the production of hydrogen using water electrolysis, these
processes of hydrogen production would be economically feasible and can be implemented
on a commercial scale. As for methanol and DME, some other processes for the chemical
utilization of CO2, such as production of formaldehyde or acetic acid, can be considered in
view of the global concerns of CO2 mitigation, reducing the consumption of fossil fuels
and providing economical alternative fuels with no hazardous emissions.",0
