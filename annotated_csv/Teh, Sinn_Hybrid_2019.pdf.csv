9,"Abstract: Due to increasingly stringent legal requirements and escalating environmental control costs,
chemical industries have paid close attention to sustainable development without compromising
their economic performance. Thus, chemical industries are in need of systematic tools to conduct
sustainability assessments of their process/plant design. In order to avoid making costly retroﬁts
at later stages, assessments during the preliminary design stage should be performed.
In this
paper, a systematic framework is presented for chemical processes at the preliminary design stage.
Gross proﬁt, Health Quotient Index (HQI), Inherent Safety Index (ISI) and the Waste Reduction (WAR)
algorithm are used to assess the economic performance, health, safety and environmental impact of
the process, respectively. The fuzzy optimization approach is used to analyse the trade-oﬀ among the
four aspects simultaneously, as they often conﬂict with each other. Deviation between the solution
obtained from mathematical optimization model and process simulator is determined to ensure the
validity of the model. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on 1, 4-butanediol
production is presented.",0

11,1. Introduction,0
12,"Process design is a core element in the ﬁeld of chemical engineering. It can be considered a
centre point, bringing together all chemical engineering components as a whole. Process design
is associated with creating processes or improving existing processes. An integral part of process
design is process synthesis. Process synthesis is deﬁned as “the discrete decision-making activities of
conjecturing (1) which of the many available component parts one should use, and (2) how they should
be interconnected to structure the optimal solution to a given design problem.” [1]. The ﬁeld of process
synthesis has seen signiﬁcant developments since its inception in the 1960s led by the late Roger W.
H. Sargent [2]. Most notably, key pioneering contributions have been an integral part of establishing
what process synthesis is and what it entails. For instance, Nishida et al. [3] provided an important
overview of developments within the boundary of process synthesis and deﬁned process synthesis
as “an act of determining the optimal interconnection of processing units as well as the optimal type",0

17,"and design of the units within a process system”. Meanwhile, the Onion model [4] was proposed as a
systematic overview and guide to process synthesis thinking. The Onion model emphasized that a
reactor is designed ﬁrst followed by separation and recycle streams, heat recovery systems and utility
systems [4]. Foo and Ng [5] then extended the Onion model further by incorporating material recovery
and treatment systems (see Figure 1). On the other hand, Douglas’ model is another well-accepted
decision hierarchy approach that was proposed for process synthesis in the late 80s [6].",0

19,"To date,",0
20,"there has been a vast number of developed process synthesis methodologies.
Often, these methodologies pay close attention to the technical and economic performance of a
process design. Meanwhile, other aspects such as safety, occupational health and environmental
impacts are typically considered at the later/ﬁnal stages of design [7,8]. However, several papers argue
that these aspects should be considered at the preliminary stage of process synthesis as the cost of
process improvement and operational risks can be signiﬁcantly lowered compared to at the later stages
(detailed design) [9,10]. In this respect, several alternative methods for evaluating occupational health,
safety and environmental impacts have been presented.",0
21,"In the area of safety evaluations, Edwards and Lawrence [11] developed the earliest method
for assessing inherent safety in a given process. This method is known as Prototype Index of Inherent
Safety (PIIS). PIIS ranks the inherent safety level of alternative chemical process routes based on main
reactions and parameters such as pressure, temperature, yield, heat of reaction, inventory, ﬂammability,
toxicity and explosiveness. Despite considering the mentioned parameters, PIIS focuses solely on
the main reaction of a process and not the other parts of the process. In view of this, Heikkila [12]
proposed an alternative approach called the Inherent Safety Index (ISI). ISI considers the same factors as
in the PIIS along with additional ones such as corrosions, side reactions, and inventory for both inside",0
22,"Processes 2019, 7, 200",0
23,3 of 18,0
24,"and outside the battery limits, types of equipment and process structure. Later, Palaniappan et al. [13]
added a few supplementary indexes such as worst reaction index, overall chemical index and total
chemical index to the previously proposed ISI to form i-Safe.",0
25,"Aside from safety, various methods have been developed to evaluate occupational health.
For example, Hassim and Edwards [14] developed Process Route Healthiness Index (PRHI) to rank the
process alternatives based on the potential of working activities and process conditions that may harm
workers. However, PRHI is not suitable for assessment in the preliminary design stage, as it requires
complete process information (e.g., points for manual handling etc.). In this respect, Hassim et al.
developed the Inherent Occupational Health Index (IOHI) [10], which is suitable for application at the
initial stage of the process research and development (R&D). This work was then extended to a more
detailed assessment called the Health Quotient Index (HQI), which uses detailed process information
available in the preliminary design stage [15]. HQI is able to rank the process alternatives based on
health risk values from the fugitive emissions and to calculate the risk of a given process.",0
26,"Apart from occupational health, there are many well-established approaches reported in the
literature on environmental impact assessments. The Environmental Hazard Index (EHI) [16] and
Atmospheric Hazard Index (AHI) [17] are among the early methods that assess inherent environmental
performance of chemical process routes. Later, Gunasekera and Edwards [18] integrated EHI with
AHI into a new method which is known as Inherent Environmental Toxicity Hazard (IETH). IETH can
estimate the inherent environmental friendliness of a chemical plant in all media including air, soil and
aquatic due to total loss of contaminants. Cabezas et al. [19] then introduced the generalized Waste
Reduction (WAR) algorithm. This algorithm determines the total environmental impacts based on the
Potential Environmental Index (PEI) balance, which assigned environmental impact values to diﬀerent
pollutants. Young and Cabezas [20] extended PEI balance to integrate the energy consumption of the
chemical process into the environmental evaluation. Similarly, Andiappan et al. [21] presented the
incremental environmental burden assessment (IEBA), which used the concept of economic potential
assessment method developed by Seider et al. [22] to determine the new environmental burden for
each process.",0
27,"It is essential to note that the abovementioned evaluation methods focus only on assessing
the performance of a process design based on just one aspect (e.g., safety or occupational health
or environmental impact) and not addressing them simultaneously.
In this respect, there have
been attempts to develop process synthesis approaches that address safety, occupational health and
environmental impacts simultaneously. For instance, Azapagic et al. [8] and Othman et al. [23] presented
sustainable assessment and design selection approaches that consider economic, environmental,
and social aspects. Besides, Al-Sharrah et al. [24] presented a multi-objective optimization model
which considers environmental impact, economic performance and operational risk simultaneously
for the petrochemical industry. Liew et al. [25] developed a systematic approach to the screening of
sustainable chemical reaction pathways at the research and development (R&D) stage. Based on the
proposed approach, fuzzy optimization is used to trade-oﬀ economic performance, health, safety and
environmental impact. Similarly, Ng et al. [26] presented a multi-objective process synthesis approach
which considered economic performance, health, safety and environmental impact for bioreﬁneries.
Following this, a visualization tool called the Piper diagram was also proposed for considering economic,
safety and environmental aspects simultaneously [27]. However, due to its graphical nature, the Piper
diagram is unable to consider process optimization.",0
28,"It is clear that the abovementioned work presents approaches to evaluate safety, occupational
health and environmental impacts at the preliminary stage of design. However, these approaches focus
on preliminary screening without considering operating conditions in a given process. The choice of
process operating conditions has a process direct impact on screening decisions and this should be
given closer attention. To address this, process simulators can be used to analyse operating conditions
for a given process. Process simulators can be used to represent chemical processes in terms of
mathematical models and solve them to attain insights on their performance [28]. Process simulation",0
29,"Processes 2019, 7, 200",0
30,4 of 18,0
31,"is an essential and complementary task of process synthesis, as it predicts how a process design
would behave under deﬁned operating conditions [29,30]. Despite the beneﬁts of process simulators,
they suﬀer from various limitations. For instance, simulators are limited to considering a single
objective (e.g., product yield or production rate) at a given run. This limitation disables simulators
from ﬁnding a trade-oﬀ between multiple aspects such as process economics, occupational health,
safety and environmental impacts for a given process design. In order to consider multiple aspects
simultaneously, multi-objective optimization is required.",0
32,"As such, this paper presents a systematic framework which combines the beneﬁts from both
process simulation and multi-objective optimization to address economic, environmental, health and
safety aspects simultaneously at the preliminary design stage. This paper is structured as follows:
First, a formal problem statement is given in Section 2. A systematic framework for preliminary process
design is presented in Section 3; To illustrate the proposed framework, a case study on the screening of
1,4-butanediol production processes is presented in Section 4; and the work is ﬁnally concluded in
Section 5.",0
33,2. Problem Statement,0
34,"The problem addressed in this work is stated as follows; given a set of alternative processes k to
produce chemical product (in a given output stream) p. Each alternative process k has a set of unit
operation j with operating capacities, xj,k and a set of (output) stream p to or from unit operation j
represented by matrix ap,j,k. Alongside this, each alternative process k diﬀers in economic performance,
health, safety and environment impacts. In this work, four objectives are considered for performing a
preliminary evaluation and screening of alternative process k. The economic performance is determined
based on the gross proﬁt of alternative process k (GP). The health impacts of process alternative k are
evaluated using Health Quotient Index (HQI). Meanwhile, the safety and environmental impact of
each alternative process k are determined via Inherent Safety Index (ISI) and Potential Environmental
Index (WAR) respectively.",0
35,"This work combines the advantages of process simulation, input-output modelling (IOM) and
fuzzy optimization to determine the trade-oﬀ between the GP, HQI, ISI and WAR objectives. In fuzzy
optimization, the degree of satisfaction (λk) is introduced to quantify the degree of satisfaction for four
objectives in each alternative process k. Following this, the alternative process k with the highest λk
will be selected. A detailed description of the proposed framework to address the stated problem is
presented in the following section.",0
36,3. Framework for Preliminary Process Design,0
37,"Figure 2 presents the proposed framework for preliminary process design, which considers
economic performance, health, safety and environment impacts simultaneously. As shown,
the proposed framework begins by identifying the product i that is expected to be produced.
Next, alternative process k which produce product i is determined. In order to analyse the performance
of each alternative process k, process simulation tools (e.g., Aspen HYSYS, SuperPro Designer, PRO/II,
etc.) can be used to simulate the process. Based on the simulation results, process data such as mass
ﬂow rates and energy requirements for each process unit j can be determined. These data are then
used to develop an input-output model for each process. Input-output model was presented by
Leontief [31,32] to analyse the relationship among the raw materials requirement, goods production
and the exchange of materials within diﬀerent economic sectors. Tan et al. [33] extended the usage
of input-output model in life cycle assessment and ecological footprint analysis. Aviso et al. [34]
integrated the approach with optimization framework to analyse the eco-industrial supply chain
under a water footprint constraint. Recently, the input-output model has been used to describe the
material and energy balance of processes in a system [35]. Based on the approach [35], the optimal
operational adjustment in multi-functional energy systems in response to process inoperability can be
determined. Kasivisvanathan et al. [36] also used the input-output model with robust optimization for",0

note that these objectives conﬂict with each other. To address such conﬂict, this work employs a
multi-objective approach known as fuzzy optimization. Fuzzy optimization is a simple multi-objective
optimization approach that was founded upon the fuzzy decision-making approach introduced
by Bellman and Zadeh [40]. Zimmermann [41] then extended the fuzzy approach to deal with
linear and non-linear programming problems that contain multiple objectives. In this approach,
a continuous interdependence variable, λ, which is also known as the degree of satisfaction, is introduced.
Every fuzzy constraint will be satisﬁed partially at least to λ. Thus, the multi-objective functions in the
optimization can be integrated into a single objective function within the optimization framework.",0

conﬁguration based on the aforementioned four objectives. Based on the optimized solution,
the operating capacities, xj,k of the selected process conﬁguration are then examined. If the operating
capacities do not diﬀer from the values used in the preliminary simulation, then the selected process k
can be recommended for the next process design phase. However, if the operating capacities do diﬀer
from the preliminary simulation, the selected process k would be re-simulated in accordance to the
optimized operating capacities. Once the selected process k is re-simulated, the operating capacities
are checked. In the event where the operating capacities in the simulation exceed an allowable error
margin (i.e., ≥10%), the preliminary simulation must be revisited for troubleshooting. For cases where
the operating capacities are within the allowed error margin, the re-simulated conditions for process k
can be recommended for the next process design phase. Note that the error margin can be changed

solvent in the industry to manufacture elastic ﬁbers, technical plastics and polyurethanes [42]. Based on

286,"As shown in Table 1, the raw materials needed for Reppe process are formaldehyde (C2H2),
acetylene (CH2O) and hydrogen (H2). Formaldehyde and acetylene are fed into two batch reactors
which operate at 5 bar, 80
C and are arranged in parallel. Formaldehyde is reacted with acetylene in
the presence of copper, bismuth and silicon dioxide supporting catalyst to produce 1,4-butynediol as
an intermediate product with a conversion rate of 60%. Aqueous sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric
acid are used to maintain the pH of the medium in the reactor within the range of pH 6 to 8. Based on
the reaction, process synthesis is started by establishing the remaining unit operations in the process.
For example, the product from the batch reactors is sent to a buﬀer tank and is stored for approximately
1–30 h before feeding to a distillation column for further separation. After separation, the bottom
product stream of the distillation column is rich in 1,4-butynediol and is fed to a trickling and
hydrogenation reactor for further reaction to produce 1,4-butanediol as the main product with a
conversion rate of 90%. The operating condition of this reactor is 160
C and 150 bar. Figure 3 shows

289,"For the Davy process, the raw materials are dimethyl maleate (DMM), C6H8O4 and hydrogen, H2.
DMM is completely vaporised with H2 before feeding into the ﬁrst ﬁxed bed reactor. The ﬁxed bed
reactor operates at 15 bar, 150
C and consists of two bed of catalysts which are palladium on alumina
and copper-zinc oxide. In the reactor, DMM is fully converted into dimethyl succinate (DMS) through
hydrogenation process in the presence of palladium on alumina as catalyst in the ﬁrst reaction stage.
In the second reaction stage, DMS is mainly converted into gammabutyrolactone (GBL) with trace
amounts of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1,4-butanediol in the presence of copper-zinc oxide as catalyst.
The conversion rate of the second reaction is 97%. Based on these two reactions, process synthesis is
conducted to list all the other required unit operations. For instance, the vapour-phase product from
the reactor is condensed at 30
C and is fed into a gas-liquid separator to remove the unreacted H2.
The unreacted H2 is then being recycled to the ﬁxed bed reactor for further reaction. Then, the GBL
rich stream from the ﬁrst reactor is fed into the second hydrogenation reactor for further reaction
to produce 1,4-butanediol with trace amounts of methanol and THF as by-products. The operating
condition of the second reactor is 210
C and 75 bar. The catalyst used in the second hydrogenation
reactor is copper-zinc oxide and the conversion of GBL to 1,4-butanediol is around 95%. The PFD
for the Davy process is shown in Figure 4. The annual production rates for both Reppe and Davy
process are assumed to be 60,000 tonnes of 1,4-butanediol, operating at 8000 h/y. The acceptable
range of ﬂuctuation on the amount of the product output given by the decision maker is within
±30%. The average height of the main unit operations in the process is assumed to be below 7 m [45].

wind speed is not available [45].",1

296,"In the following step, the input-output models are evaluated based on economic, environmental,

l,αl is assumed as one. This indicates that the impact for each category is equally important. Meanwhile,
Table 2 shows the information obtained for both Reppe and Davy processes prior to the optimisation
step. As shown in Table 2, the Davy process has higher initial GP and WAR; however, with a lower
score of HQI and ISI, compared with the Reppe process. The latter has a lower initial GP mainly due to
its higher cost of raw materials. Its higher HQI score is mainly due to the presence of harmful chemical
components in the process, such as formaldehyde and 1,4-butynediol. Note that the threshold limit
(TLV) of formaldehyde and 1,4-butanediol are very low, that is, 1.228 mg/m3 and 0.5 mg/m3 respectively.
Besides, the higher ISI score for the Reppe process is mainly due to its highly exothermic side reaction
involving formaldehyde, acetylene and hydrogen to form 2-propanol. Note that the Reppe process has
a lower score of WAR (i.e., it is safer) because it converts the hazardous raw material (formaldehyde)
to a product (1,4-butanediol) with a lower environmental impact. As such, the selection between these
two processes is complex, particularly when four diﬀerent aspects are considered simultaneously.",0

317,"In order to determine the optimum process with consideration of all aspects simultaneously, fuzzy
optimisation is used. Based on Equations (26)–(29), it is noted that lower and upper limits for GP, HQI,
ISI and WAR are required. To obtain these values, GPk is ﬁrst maximized to determine the upper limit
GPU. The corresponding values for HQIk, ISIk and WARk are used as upper limits in HQIU, ISIU and
WARU respectively. Following this, WARk is minimized to determine WARL. The corresponding GPk,
ISIk and WARk values were taken as lower limits GPL, HQIL and ISIL respectively. The obtained values

332,"After optimisation, it is observed that the operating capacity of the process has been scaled
down by 3.3% from the target production to obtain a trade-oﬀ among economic, health, safety and
environmental aspects. The reason for this is that, in order to achieve the trade-oﬀ solution shown
in Table 3, the operating capacity for the Davy process has to be scaled down by 3.3%. From here,
the new scaled down operating capacity of the Davy process is re-simulated to study the deviations.
The net output of the process streams obtained from the developed model has a slight diﬀerence to the
solution generated from process simulator with a deviation of less than 10%. This is mainly due to the
diﬀerent models used in generating the solution. The solution obtained by the mathematical model is
linear, while that used by the process simulator is in rigorous mode. Since the deviation obtained is
small, the selected Davy process with its optimized operating capacity can be recommended for the
next stage of design.",0

334,"In conclusion, this work presented a systematic framework to screen and select a sustainable
chemical process at the preliminary design stage. The presented framework consists of three main
tasks. First, process simulation was carried out to analyse the performance of each alternative process.
Based on the simulation, process data such as mass ﬂow rates and energy requirements for each process",0
335,"Processes 2019, 7, 200",0
336,15 of 18,0
337,"unit were determined. These data were then used in the next task, which is to develop an input-output
model for each process. Each input-output model was formulated to address four conﬂicting objectives.
These four objectives, namely economic performance, health, safety and environment aspects were
assessed using gross proﬁt (GP), the Health Quotient Index (HQI), the Inherent Safety Index (ISI)
and the WAR algorithm respectively. Following this, fuzzy optimization was used in the third task
to optimize the abovementioned aspects simultaneously and to select the most sustainable process.
A sustainable process in this context refers to the process with the highest degree of satisfaction (λ)
among all four aspects considered. The proposed framework was illustrated with a case study on
1,4-butanediol production, where the proposed framework was used to determine the most sustainable
process to produce 1,4-butanediol. Two processes, namely the Reppe and Davy processes were
considered. Each process was simulated using Aspen HYSYS Version 8.8 and subsequently underwent
input-output modelling. The developed input-output models were then optimized using fuzzy
optimization. Results from the case study indicate that the Davy process is more sustainable compared
to the Reppe process. In particular, the Davy process had the highest λ value. Furthermore, the results
suggest that the operating capacity of the Davy process should be scaled down by 3.3% to meet
the trade-oﬀ scores determined by the λ value obtained. Based on this recommendation, the Davy
process was re-simulated. It was found that there was a small percentage of deviations between the
mathematical and process simulation models. This proved that the developed model is feasible for
determining a more sustainable process conﬁguration. For future work, a selection of diﬀerent unit
operations may be incorporated into the model to determine their impact on ﬂowsheet selection.",0
