5,"Abstract: Large-scale eco-eﬃcient production of polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn) has
garnered wide attention as environmental-friendly diesel additives. Among the various PODEn
research studies, the eﬀect of water on the PODEn process is one of the most important research ﬁelds.
In this work, the eﬀects of water content in feedstock on the reboiler duty of the PODEn process
were analyzed by rigorous simulation. To ensure the accuracy of the model, vapor–liquid equilibria
(VLE) data of PODE2-H2O were measured and the model was regressed by using the experimental
data. Furthermore, the production process consisting of raw material preparation section and PODEn
synthesis section was evaluated by comparing it with the various water contents (0, 0.05, 0.10 and
0.15 g/g) in feedstock. We found the reboiler duty in the case of 0.10 g/g water in feedstock was
lowest (77.99 MJ/kg), which is even lower than anhydrous case (100.24 MJ/kg). The results suggest
that the water can be appropriately allowed in the production, which can reduce the reboiler duty of
the PODEn.",0

7,"1. Introduction
Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers (PODEn) are environmentally benign diesel additives with
the formula of H3C-O-(CH2O)n-CH3(n ≥ 2) [1]. PODEn of chain lengths n = 3–5 have suitable ﬂash
points [2] and melting points [3], which could reduce the soot and also, indirectly, NOx during the
combustion process in compression ignition engines [4–6]. Thus, higher combustion eﬃciency could
be achieved by blending PODEn in diesel [7,8]. Moreover, PODEn can be used as oxygenated fuels to
direct oxidation fuel cells [9] and as green solvents for the chemical industry [10,11].",0
8,"Two kinds of synthesized educts are necessary for the synthesis of PODEn: end-group (CH3O-)
providers, such as methylal (DMM), methanol (MeOH), or dimethyl ethers (DME) and chain-group
(-CH2O-) providers, such as trioxane (TOX), formaldehyde (FA) or paraformaldehyde (PF) [12,13].
All these providers can be synthesized by methanol at the very start. Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl
ethers is a key research direction for coal-based methanol, facing serious oversupply in China [14].
In the published articles, there are possible synthesis routes and technologies for production of PODEn:
DMM/TOX route [15–17], DMM/PF route [14,18], DME/ TOX route [19,20], and MeOH/FA solution
route [21–23]. The routes of DMM/TOX, DME/TOX, and DMM/PF have a high yield of PODE3−5 [14,15],
but these routes have high costs due to chain-group providers TOX and PF. In contrast, the route using
MeOH/FA solution has a lower yield of PODE3−5 [23,24]. Methylal and PODE2 are the main oligomers
in the MeOH/FA solution route due to the Schulz−Flory distribution of PODEn products [25–27].",0

13,"Water in the reactants leads to the decomposition of PODEn, which is the main reason for the decrease
of PODE3–5 [4]. Therefore, the selectivity of PODE3−5 can be improved by reducing water content in
feedstock. Meanwhile, water not only aﬀects the yield of PODE3–5 but also makes the puriﬁcation
process more complicated [28]. Therefore, the eﬀects of water on the PODEn process represent one of
the most important research ﬁelds.",0
14,"Large scale green production of PODEn would be crucial if diesel-PODEn blends are applied to
tackle the worldwide formidable air pollution by particulate matter. In the articles, Burger et al. [29]
conceptually designed a large scale production in which PODEn was formed from methylal and TOX.
Tsinghua University [30] provided a technology synthesizing PODEn from methylal and PF, which was
applied in practice in Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co., Ltd. in China. Schmitz et al. [31] designed a
conceptual process for the production of PODEn by the route using the MeOH/FA solution. In addition
to the above manufacturing procedure, there are also many articles about the PODEn process [32,33].
In the articles, there is no detail on the eﬀects of water content on the manufacturing procedure and it
still needs to be explored. In the present work, we will focus on the eﬀects of water content on the
PODEn process, especially energetic eﬃciency. To attain this goal, a complete PODEn process with
lower water content needs to be established, which our group has already provided [34]. We continue
to develop this process in this work. We explored by rigorous simulation that methylal is separated as
a distillate product from mixtures containing formaldehyde, water, methanol, methylal, and PODE2.
Furthermore, the production process consisting of raw material preparation section and PODEn
synthesis section was evaluated by comparing it with the various water contents in the feedstock.",0
15,"To be able to simulate the process, the physico-chemical model used in the present work needs to
be built up. Starting with the pioneering work [28], the model was developed and tested [35–45]. In the
model, the non-idealities in the liquid phase are taken into account using a UNIFAC-based activity
coeﬃcient model. In very recent work, the model of Schmitz et al. [46] parametrizes and validates
the model using only liquid–liquid equilibrium and not vapor–liquid equilibrium in PODE2-H2O
systems. In this work, PODE2 is a light key component that aﬀects the separation to obtain the
product. The vapor–liquid equilibrium of PODE2–H2O has inﬂuences on analysis and simulation.
Therefore, the present work closes the gap by measuring and regressing vapor–liquid equilibria data
of PODE2-H2O so that we can ensure the accuracy of the model.",0

71,4.1. Process Description,1
72,"Based on our previous work [34], a ﬂowsheet of the novel PODEn production process is depicted
in Figure 4. There are two main diﬀerences between this work and the original process. One is that the
column C3 separates methylal as a distillate product (stream 7) from mixtures containing formaldehyde,
water, mathanol, methylal, and PODE2 (stream 8), which are recycled back to the reactor. It is well
known that an azeotrope exists between methanol and methylal [51]. However, experimental results
from our batch distillation experiments show that formaldehyde has eﬀects on the methylal–methanol
azeotrope, therefore, we can obtain high-purity methylal. The batch distillation experiments are given
in supporting information. We will explore the reasons for the rigorous simulation in the following
section. The other is water and PODE2 is separated by heterogeneous azeotropic distillation. Water is
obtained from column C6 as bottom product (stream 15), and PODE2 is obtained from column C7 as
bottom product (stream 19).",1
73,"The detailed description is as follows: the feed stream 1, containing methylal, formaldehyde
and H2O, is fed to the acidic catalyzed reactor R1 to produce PODEn after mixing with the recycle
streams 6 and 7. The reactor outlet stream 2 comprising formaldehyde, H2O, methanol, methylal, and
PODEn of various chain lengths is fed to a rectifying sequence to separate main products of PODE3−5
and recycle other components. The column C1 separates PODEn of chain lengths n ≥ 3 as the bottom
product (stream 4), which avoid formaldehyde polymerization when all other light components are
distilled together as overhead products (stream 3). Column C2 separates target products of PODE3−5
and recycles other components back to the reactor. Column C3 separates methylal as an overhead
product (stream 7) from mixture formaldehyde, H2O, methanol, methylal and PODE2 (stream 8) which
are recycled back to the reactor. Column C4 using water as entrainer can separate formaldehyde from
the system (PODE2 + formaldehyde + H2O + methanol). Thus, formalin can be segregated from the
intricate mixture by stream 11. For column C5, it is proved that methanol is obtained in a sharp split
as a top product (stream 12), and PODE2 with water is obtained as the bottom product (stream 13).
Finally, water is obtained from column C6 as the bottom product (stream 15), and PODE2 is obtained
from column C7 as the bottom product (stream 19) by heterogeneous azeotropic distillation. PODE2
can be used as a product or be recycled to the reactor R1 by an additional pipeline.",1
74,"The principles of optimization are as follows: by controlling the same product quality through
reﬂux ratio and quantity of distillate, the number of theoretical plates and feed plate is optimized.
When increasing the number of theoretical plates has little inﬂuence on the energy consumption of the
reboiler, the number of theoretical stages is determined. After determining the number of theoretical
stages, it is possible to ﬁnd the feeding plate with the lowest energy consumption of the reboiler. In this
way, the separation conditions of the distillation column can be obtained.",1

80,4.2. Eﬀects of FA/MeOH Ratio and Water Content on Methylal Separation,0
81,"Methylal needs to be returned to the reactor and separated from the mixture containing
formaldehyde, water, methanol, methylal, and PODE2. However, batch distillation experimental
results show that the high-purity methylal, as distillate product, can be obtained from column C3.
The reasons for this phenomenon were explored. However, this system involving formaldehyde,
methanol and water is complicated, therefore, it is diﬃcult to discuss the inﬂuences of each of these
components. The FA/MeOH ratio and water content have eﬀects on eﬄuent from the top of the
distillation column. In this work, we just focus on the inﬂuence of the FA/MeOH ratio and the water
content in Stream 3 at normal pressure to simplify the problem. The result is as follows:",0
82,"The eﬀect of FA/MeOH ratio is shown in Figure 5. The conditions are far enough to meet the
separation requirements that the number of plates (N) is 40 and the reﬂux ratio (RR) is 2. With the
increasing FA/MeOH ratio, the concentration of methylal from the top of the distillation column ﬁrst
increases and then decreases, and there is a peak value between 1.4 and 1.5. The reason is that methanol
reacting with formaldehyde to polymers of HFn from the Equations (3) and (4) are withdrawn at the
bottom of the distillation column. According to the results, in order to gain higher concentrations of
methylal, it is beneﬁcial to ensure that the FA/MeOH ratio is between 1.4 and 1.5.",0
83,"Figure 5. The eﬀect of FA/MeOH ratio on eﬄuent from the top of distillation column. (N = 40, RR = 2,
no water).",0
84,"The eﬀect of water content is shown in Figure 6a,b. Two orientations need to be discussed in the
conditions (N = 40, RR = 2). One is when FA/MeOH ratio is less than 1.4, and the other is greater than 1.5.
Therefore, FA/MeOH ratio was selected 1 and 2 respectively. FA/MeOH ratio of 1 is shown in Figure 6a.
At this point, the main composition of mixture from the top of the distillation column is methylal, trace
of methanol, trace of water and almost no formaldehyde. It is not necessary to increase the water
content without restriction and limit the water content to 0.15, as higher concentrations of water lead to
considerably decreased yields of PODEn in the reactor [31]. With the increase of water content, water
appeared, methanol content decreased and methylal content increased. The results showed that the
presence of water was beneﬁcial to increase the concentration of methylal. When the FA/MeOH ratio is
less than 1.4, formaldehyde is not enough to completely react with methanol. When water is added to
the system, water-PODE2 azeotrope is more stable than FA-MeOH-PODE2 azeotrope which appears in
physico-chemical model. Formaldehyde is released to form HFn to combine more methanol, so that
the content of methylal increases and the content of methanol decreases.",0

88,"A FA/MeOH ratio of 2 is shown in Figure 6b. The results show that the content of methylal
increases ﬁrst and then decreases with the increase of water content, formaldehyde decreases ﬁrst
and then disappears, methanol appears ﬁrst and then increases, and water also appears in the
substances on the top of the distillation column. It can be concluded that when the FA/MeOH ratio is
greater than 1.5, appropriate water content is helpful to increase the content of methylal. When the
FA/MeOH ratio is higher than 1.5, excessive formaldehyde is enough to completely react with methanol.
When water is added to the system, water reacts with formaldehyde to the polymers of MGn from
Equations (1) and (2). Therefore, the concentration of formaldehyde at the top of the distillation column
decreases and the concentration of methylal increases. When limits are exceeded, water competes with
formaldehyde. The result is a decrease of methylal and an increase of methanol.",0
89,"The analysis of FA/MeOH ratio and water content helps us to understand this complex reactive
multicomponent mixture. It is generally known that the product composition of the reaction is diﬀerent
when formaldehyde with diﬀerent water content is added to the reactor as feed. At the same time, it also
aﬀects the separation of methylal due to diﬀerent water content and FA/MeOH ratio. The separation
of methylal with diﬀerent water content in formaldehyde as feed (stream 1 in Figure 4) is shown in
Figure 7. The results indicate that high purity methylal can be obtained in the range of 0.05-0.20 g/g
water content in formaldehyde. If the distillate product is returned to the reactor, the range of less than
0.05 g/g water content in formaldehyde is also allowed.",0

PODEn synthesis section. To explore the eﬀects of water content on energy consumption per unit
mass of PODE3-5, the energy of the chain-group providers with diﬀerent water content should also
be considered. The chain-group providers we chose was trioxane. Trioxane is a very important
raw material in the production of PODEn. The analysis of trioxane is representative, which helps us
understand why the route DMM/TOX costs more. The separation process with diﬀerent water content
is diﬀerent. However, producing PODEn in diﬀerent processes need to meet the same constraints.
These constraints are given in Table 1. To simplify issues, the energy consumption we discuss is just
reboiler duty, which basically reﬂects the level of energy expenditure. Power for the transfer of material
is not considered.",0

formaldehyde, trioxane, and water, the reboiler duty of each equipment in the process is shown
in Figure 9. It can be seen that allowing water and formaldehyde in feedstock can reduce reboiler
duty. As the allowable water content and formaldehyde increase, the circulation does not have to be
increased to improve the quality of the product, which has a signiﬁcant impact on column T2.",0

of the column C1 is the separation of PODEn≥3 as the bottom product from mixtures of formaldehyde,
water, methanol, methylal, and PODEn≥2. The role of column C5 is separating methanol as a top
product from mixtures of water, methanol, and PODE2. This means that the reasons for the increase
of reboiler duty are the increase of methanol in the reactor by decomposition and the decrease in
the conversion rate of PODEn. It should be noted that since only the reboiler duty is considered,
the accurate cost of the product needs further analysis required to decide which PODEn synthesis
process is economic.",0
109,"Total energy expenditure per unit mass of PODE3-5 with diﬀerent water content is shown in

content is 0.15 g/g, the total reboiler duty increases owing to the decrease in the yield of PODE3−5.
Total energy expenditure per unit mass of PODE3−5 is aﬀected by two factors: raw material preparation
section and PODEn synthesis section. As the concentration of formaldehyde and water in trioxane
increases, the reboiler duty decreases. However, with the increase of water content, the conversion",0

by means of process simulation. The water content not only aﬀects the separation process but also the

was lowest (77.99 MJ/kg), which is even lower than anhydrous case (100.24 MJ/kg). The water can be
appropriately allowed in production, which can reduce the reboiler duty of the product.",0
