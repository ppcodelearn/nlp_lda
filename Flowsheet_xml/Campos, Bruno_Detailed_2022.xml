Abstract: In order to increase the typically low equilibrium CO2 conversion to methanol using
commercially proven technology, the addition of two intermediate condensation units between
reaction steps is evaluated in this work. Detailed process simulations with heat integration and
techno-economic analyses of methanol synthesis from green H2 and captured CO2 are presented here,
comparing the proposed process with condensation steps with the conventional approach. In the new
process, a CO2 single-pass conversion of 53.9% was achieved, which is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the
conversion of the conventional process (28.5%) and its equilibrium conversion (30.4%). Consequently,
the total recycle stream Ô¨Çow was halved, which reduced reactant losses in the purge stream and the
compression work of the recycle streams, lowering operating costs by 4.8% (61.2 M‚Ç¨¬∑a‚àí1). In spite of
the additional number of heat exchangers and Ô¨Çash drums related to the intermediate condensation
units, the Ô¨Åxed investment costs of the improved process decreased by 22.7% (94.5 M‚Ç¨). This was a
consequence of the increased reaction rates and lower recycle Ô¨Çows, reducing the required size of the
main equipment. Therefore, intermediate condensation steps are beneÔ¨Åcial for methanol synthesis
from H2/CO2, signiÔ¨Åcantly boosting CO2 single-pass conversion, which consequently reduces both
the investment and operating costs.

1. Introduction
Sustainable solutions are required to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the
transportation and industrial sectors, shrinking the dependency on fossil fuels. With the
continuously increasing installed capacity of wind and solar power plants [1], adequate
energy storage solutions have to be implemented in order to deal with their Ô¨Çuctuating
nature. Therefore, the conversion of electricity into valuable chemicals and fuels, a concept
often called power-to-fuels or power-to-X, can make an important contribution to the
future energy system [2]. In this context, key process steps are hydrogen generation via
electrolysis (primary conversion) [3,4] and methanol synthesis (secondary conversion) [5].
Methanol can be used as a fuel substitute or additive, either in fuel cells or via
combustion [2], as a feedstock in the production of base chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde)
and liquid fuels (e.g., gasoline, oxymethylene ethers, jetfuel) [6‚Äì8], and also as a solvent.
Methanol fuel has recently attracted signiÔ¨Åcant interest, especially in China, where the
consumption of methanol for thermal applications (e.g., boilers, kilns, cooking stoves) and
in the transportation section amounted to 5.7 Mton¬∑a‚àí1 (year 2019) [9].
The current global capacity of methanol production is 164 Mton¬∑a‚àí1 (year 2021), with
an annual increase of 10% projected for the next decade [10]. Traditionally, methanol
synthesis is fed by fossil-based syngas, which comes either from steam reforming of natural
gas or from coal gasiÔ¨Åcation [11]. However, sustainable syngas production is gaining

importance, such as from renewable electricity and captured CO2, and also from biomass.

The current global capacity of methanol production is 164 Mton¬∑a‚àí1 (year 2021), 
with an annual increase of 10% projected for the next decade [10]. Traditionally, 
methanol synthesis is fed by fossil-based syngas, which comes either from steam 
reforming of natural gas or from coal gasification [11]. However, sustainable syngas 
production is gaining importance, such as from renewable electricity and captured 
CO2, and also from biomass. In Figure 1, a scheme is presented showing the 
intermediate position of methanol in the conversion of both fossil-based and 
sustainable syngas to added-value chemicals and fuels, as well as methanol end-
use applications.

and fuels. Icons from: Freepik, Flaticon [12]. 
The current world-scale technology for methanol synthesis is mostly based on 
the application of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) catalysts in either multi-tube reactors with 
boiling water as the cooling fluid, normally called isothermal reactors (e.g., the 
Lurgi process, the Linde process), or adiabatic reactors with intermediate cold 
syngas quenching, generally named quench reactors (e.g., ICI and the Casale 
process, the Haldor Topsoe process) [11,13]. Less common but also industrially 
applied are the adiabatic reactors with intermediate cooling (e.g., the Kellogg 
process, the Toyo process) [11,14]. Normally, temperatures between 200 and 300 ¬∞C 
and pressures between 50 and 100 bar are applied [13]. 
Methanol can be produced from either CO (Equation (1)) or CO2 (Equation (2)), 
with the reverse water‚Äìgas shift reaction (rWGSR, Equation (3)) also occurring. If 
the feed gas contains both CO and CO2, there is a prevailing opinion that direct CO 
hydrogenation (Equation (1)) on Cu/Zn-based catalysts is significantly slower than 
CO2 hydrogenation [15,16], and kinetic models not considering this reaction can 
adequately simulate experimental data [17‚Äì19].

With regard to the general use of CO2 as a carbon source, several process simulations
and techno-economic analyses of methanol synthesis from green hydrogen and captured
CO2 have been reported, with the CO2 source being either a cleaned industrial Ô¨Çue gas or
concentrated atmospheric CO2 (i.e., through carbon capture units, CCUs) [20‚Äì22]. P√©rez-
Fortes et al. [20] and Szima et al. [21] simulated a methanol synthesis plant with CZA,

having a total production of 440 and 100 kton MeOH¬∑a‚àí1, respectively. Heat integration
was considered in both studies, with the plant being energetically self-sufÔ¨Åcient. Cordero-
Lanzac et al. [22] simulated the production of 275 kton MeOH¬∑a‚àí1 with an In2O3/Co
catalyst. In all studies, it was concluded that economic viability can be achieved if reactant
prices signiÔ¨Åcantly decrease or if CO2 taxation is enforced. Nonetheless, it is expected
that the costs of electrolysis and CCUs might considerably decrease in the foreseeable
future [23,24], and the Ô¨Årst industrial-scale plants to produce e-methanol and e-gasoline
are expected to start operating in 2024‚Äì2025 [25,26].
A general argument is the thermodynamic restrictions of CO2 conversion to methanol
compared to CO conversion (see Figure 2), whereby only limited methanol yields are
achievable even at elevated pressures and lower temperatures. Consequently, a low CO2
single-pass conversion (XCO2,SP) is obtained independently of the reactor size, leading to
large recycle streams, which increase operating costs and cause higher reactant losses in
purge streams.

condensation [27,28] or membrane reactors [29], but these technologies are not yet 
ready for commercialization. A feasible approach using commercially proven 
technology is the implementation of intermediate condensation steps between 
reactor units displaced in series. In the Davy series loop methanol process, two

methanol yield from H2/CO2 syngas, such an approach has still not received particular
attention, and plant simulations with heat integration and techno-economic analyses are
not available in the literature yet, to the best of our knowledge.
In this work, the conventional approach (named here the ‚Äòone-step process‚Äô) is com-
pared with a new alternative approach including two condensation steps (named here the
‚Äòthree-step process‚Äô). Using our recently developed kinetic model for methanol synthesis [19],
both processes were implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze and select key
process parameters (i.e., cooling Ô¨Çuid temperature, number of reactor modules, and purge
fraction). With the optimized parameters, detailed methanol synthesis plants with heat inte-
gration were implemented in Aspen Plus, and techno-economic analyses were performed.

2. Methodology
2.1. Process Overview
In the present work, a methanol synthesis plant from H2/CO2 with a production of
145 ton¬∑h‚àí1 is considered. This value is based on an ongoing power-to-gasoline project
via H2/CO2 conversion to methanol [26], whose Ô¨Ånal goal is a gasoline production of
5.5¬∑108 L¬∑a‚àí1, which corresponds to a methanol production of 1.16 Mton¬∑a‚àí1 or 145 ton¬∑h‚àí1
(assuming a yield of 80% in the methanol-to-gasoline process and plant operating hours
of 8000 h¬∑a‚àí1).
In our simulations, feed carbon dioxide comes from the cleaned Ô¨Çue gas of nearby
industries (e.g., a cement industry) at 25 ‚ó¶C and 1 bar, with a purity of 99.5% mol/mol (the
rest was water). Feed hydrogen comes from water electrolysis at 25 ‚ó¶C and 30 bar, with a
purity of 99.5% mol/mol (the rest was nitrogen). Although it is possible to obtain these
feedstocks in an extremely high purity (e.g., 99.99% mol/mol) [31,32], we chose a more
conservative scenario, which also allows a proper simulation of inert material accumulation
in the plant.
As pressure has a signiÔ¨Åcant inÔ¨Çuence on the thermodynamic equilibrium of methanol
synthesis (see Figure 2), the reactor operating pressure was set to 70 bar. Although higher
pressures are reported to have potential in methanol synthesis [33,34], they were out
of the scope of this work, since considerable extrapolations in the kinetic model would
be necessary, and condensation inside the reactor might have to be taken into account.
Besides, higher pressures increase compression costs and might also require more expensive
materials to build the equipment.
The dimensions of the reactor modules were chosen to be close to the upper size
limits that are currently commercially available. That is, each reactor module consisted of
a shell containing 33,000 tubes with 12.5 m length and an inner diameter of 3.75 cm.
Since the heat generation in CO2 hydrogenation is lower than in CO hydrogenation
(Equations (1) and (2)), less heat transfer area is necessary. Because of that, the tube inner
diameter chosen in this work (3.75 cm) was larger than the size typically used for CO
conversion to methanol (2.5 cm). Considering 1050 kg¬∑m‚àí3 as the apparent catalyst bed
density [35], the total CZA catalyst loading of each reactor module was 478.13 ton. A total
pressure loss of 0.75 bar was considered for each reactor module [36].
2.1.1. One-Step Approach‚ÄîProcess Description
In Figure 3, a detailed Ô¨Çowsheet of the one-step process is presented. This is an
adapted version from a concept reported in the literature [37‚Äì39]. Feed CO2 is mixed
with a low-pressure recycle stream, and then compressed from 1 to 70 bar in a three-stage
process, including intermediate cooling (reducing compression work) and intermediate
phase separation (to remove condensed methanol and water from the recycle stream). The
resulting compressed stream is mixed with feed H2 (compressed from 30 to 70 bar in one
stage) and with a high pressure recycle stream. The mixed stream is preheated with the
product gas and enters the inner tubes of parallel reactor modules, with the temperature
being controlled by boiling water on the shell side.
The product stream is cooled down to 30 ‚ó¶C in four heat exchangers, condensing
water, methanol, and some CO2, which are separated from the light gases in a Ô¨Çash drum.
A fraction of the gas stream is purged, and the remaining stream is recompressed to 70 bar
and recycled. The liquid stream from the Ô¨Çash drum is depressurized to 1 bar and heated
to 30 ‚ó¶C, vaporizing most remaining CO2. A liquid‚Äìgas separation is performed in another
Ô¨Çash drum. A fraction of the gas stream from the low-pressure Ô¨Çash drum is purged, and
the rest is recycled by mixing with feed CO2. The liquid stream from the low-pressure
Ô¨Çash drum is preheated and fed to a packed column, where methanol in high purity
(&gt;99.5% m/m) is recovered in the liquid distillate, water is recovered in the bottom, and
most of the remaining CO2 is recovered in the gas distillate.

The product stream is cooled down to 30 ¬∞C in four heat exchangers, 
condensing water, methanol, and some CO2, which are separated from the light 
gases in a flash drum. A fraction of the gas stream is purged, and the remaining 
stream is recompressed to 70 bar and recycled. The liquid stream from the flash 
drum is depressurized to 1 bar and heated to 30 ¬∞C, vaporizing most remaining 
CO2. A liquid‚Äìgas separation is performed in another flash drum. A fraction of the 
gas stream from the low-pressure flash drum is purged, and the rest is recycled by 
mixing with feed CO2. The liquid stream from the low-pressure flash drum is 
preheated and fed to a packed column, where methanol in high purity (&gt;99.5% 
m/m) is recovered in the liquid distillate, water is recovered in the bottom, and most 
of the remaining CO2 is recovered in the gas distillate. 
The purge streams are burned with 15% air excess in a fired heater [40]. The 
heat of reaction of both the purge combustion and the methanol synthesis are used 
in a water Rankine cycle to produce electricity. The cycle starts with liquid water at 
1 bar and 99.6 ¬∞C being pumped to a certain pressure, whose boiling temperature 
corresponds to the desired reactor temperature. Pressurized water reaches its 
boiling temperature in two steps (heat exchanger and fired heater) and vaporizes 
inside the reactor modules. The produced saturated steam is further heated in the

saturated steam is further heated in the Ô¨Åred heater and then performs work in a turbine,
with a discharge pressure of 1.43 bar (Tboiling = 110 ‚ó¶C). The resulting low-pressure steam
condenses partially in the column reboiler, and total condensation is completed in a heat
exchanger, closing the water cycle.
2.1.2. Three-Step Approach‚ÄîProcess Description
In Figure 4, a detailed Ô¨Çowsheet of the three-step process is presented. In this approach,
the feed compression and recycling of non-converted reactants occurs similarly to the one-
step process. The mixed feed stream is preheated and enters the Ô¨Årst reactor module. The
product gas is cooled down to 45 ‚ó¶C in three steps, and the condensed stream (mostly water,
methanol, and some CO2) is separated from the light gases in a Ô¨Çash drum. The gas stream
is preheated and enters the second reactor module. The second product gas is cooled down
to 30 ‚ó¶C in three steps, and the condensed stream (mostly water, methanol, and some CO2)
is separated from the gas stream in another Ô¨Çash drum.

formed with one Ô¨Çash drum at high pressure, one Ô¨Çash drum at ambient pressure, and one
distillation column.
The purge stream is burned in a Ô¨Åred heater with preheated air. In the water cycle,
pressurized water is preheated and distributed to the reactor modules. A fraction of the
produced saturated steam is split and used to preheat the water while the remaining steam
is further heated in the Ô¨Åred heater. Supersaturated steam performs work in a turbine, with
a discharge pressure of 1.43 bar (Tboiling = 110 ‚ó¶C). The resulting low-pressure steam is
partially condensed in the column reboiler, and total condensation is completed in a heat
exchanger, closing the water cycle.

2.2. Process Simulation in Matlab
Before implementing the Ô¨Ånal version of each plant in Aspen Plus, different scenarios
were investigated in Matlab. Therefore, optimal key parameters were selected, such as the
total number of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the temperature of the cooling
Ô¨Çuid in the reactor.
In order to simulate the reactor, the following considerations were made: there are only
variations along the length of the reactor (1D assumption), the inÔ¨Çuence of back-mixing is
neglected (plug Ô¨Çow assumption), and the cooling Ô¨Çuid temperature (Tw, in K) is constant.
Starting from mass and energy balances, the differential equations of the total mole Ô¨Çow of
a single tube (
.n, in mol¬∑s‚àí1), the mole fraction of each component j (yj), and the temperature
(T, in K) in the axial direction z are shown as follows:

where mCat is the catalyst mass (kg), L is the reactor length (m), yjk is the stoichiometric
coefÔ¨Åcient of component j in reaction k, rk is the rate of reaction k (mol¬∑kgcat¬∑s‚àí1), CP,f is the
heat capacity of the Ô¨Çuid (J¬∑mol¬∑K‚àí1), h f is the speciÔ¨Åc enthalpy of the Ô¨Çuid (J¬∑mol‚àí1), hj is
the speciÔ¨Åc enthalpy of component j, U is the global heat transfer coefÔ¨Åcient (W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1),
and Di is the inner diameter of a single tube (m).
The temperature-dependent parameters (CP,f , h f , hj, U) were updated in each in-
tegration point in the axial direction. Heat capacity and enthalpy were calculated with
the thermodynamic functions provided by Goos et al. [41], which are detailed in the
Supplementary Material (Section A) along with the derivation of the differential equations.
The global heat transfer coefÔ¨Åcient was estimated (U) by summing the heat transfer resis-
tances in the axial direction, according to the methodology described in the literature [42,43]
(see Section B of the Supplementary Material).
The methodology to calculate the reaction rates (rk) is described in Section 2.3. The
system of differential equations was solved with the Matlab function ode45, with absolute
and relative tolerances set to 10‚àí10.
In order to simplify the simulation of the separation steps in Matlab, the following
procedure was applied. Both processes were implemented in Aspen Plus, considering a
total of six reactor modules, a purge fraction of 2%, and Tw = 235 ‚ó¶C. The values of the split
ratio of each component in the liquid and gas phase of each Ô¨Çash drum and the distillation
column were extracted. For example, in the column of the one-step process, the methanol
distribution in the outlet streams was: 3.80% in the gas distillate, 96.13% in the liquid
distillate, and 0.06% in the bottom. The split ratio of all the components were taken from
Aspen Plus and were considered constant for the different scenarios investigated in Matlab
(i.e., variations in the number of reactor modules, purge fraction, and Tw). These split ratios
are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section C).
Flowsheet convergence was achieved in Matlab by an iterative method, as there were
two cycles of streams due to recycling unconverted reactants. First, educated initial guesses
of the composition and total mole Ô¨Çow of each recycle stream were given. In each iteration,
the recycle stream mole Ô¨Çow and its composition were calculated and used in the next
iteration until the tolerance criterion was fulÔ¨Ålled:

where

2.3. Kinetic Modeling of the Methanol Synthesis
The kinetic simulation of the methanol synthesis was performed with our previously
published six-parameter model (Model-6p) [19], whose considerations regarding the reac-
tion mechanism, the assumption of the rate determining steps, and the most abundant sur-
face species were based on our detailed microkinetic model [15]. This six-parameter model
was validated with 496 experimental points from different laboratory plants [15,18,44],
which contemplated temperatures between 210 and 260 ‚ó¶C, pressures between 20 and 60 bar,
gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) between 1.8 and 40 LS¬∑h‚àí1¬∑gcat‚àí1, and a variety of
syngas (H2/CO/CO2/N2) feed compositions, including 126 points with only H2/CO2/N2
in feed.
In this model, two main reactions are considered: CO2 hydrogenation (Equation (2))
and the rWGSR (Equation (3)). The reaction rates (rCO2 hyd., rrWGSR) in mol¬∑kgcat‚àí1¬∑s‚àí1 are
described as follows:

Here, A2‚àí3 and EA,2‚àí3 are kinetic parameters, R is the universal gas constant, œÜZn is
the zinc coverage on the surface, Œ∏b and Œ∏c are the free active sites b and c, fj is the fugacity
of gas component j (bar), and K0
P,k is the global equilibrium constant of reaction k.
The Peng‚ÄìRobinson equation of state is used to calculate the fugacities [45], consider-
ing the binary interaction parameters reported by Meng et al. [46] and Meng and Duan [47],
and an effective hydrogen acentric factor of ‚àí0.05 proposed by Deiters et al. [48].
The zinc coverage is dependent on temperature and gas concentration [49], and its
exact quantiÔ¨Åcation under reaction conditions is difÔ¨Åcult to predict. The zinc coverage is
then considered to be constant and equal to œÜZn = 0.50 for a general case, while it is set to
œÜZn = 0.10 for CO2-rich feed (CO2/COx &gt; 0.90). The free active sites are calculated with the

where K2‚àí3 are adsorption parameters. In Table 1, the equilibrium constants as well as the
previously estimated kinetic and adsorption parameters are summarized [19].
The side products of methanol synthesis on Cu/Zn-based catalysts (e.g., hydrocarbons
or dimethyl ether) are typically at low concentrations [13,50]. Several studies reported that
syngas conversion to hydrocarbons or dimethyl ether on commercial CZA at moderate
temperatures (T ‚â§ 260 ‚ó¶C) is signiÔ¨Åcantly low or even below detection range [15,18,44],
while Condero-Lanzac et al. [22] reported low methane production from H2/CO2 on CZA
at high temperatures (T ‚â• 275 ‚ó¶C). Saito et al. [51] observed that side product formation is
further reduced by increasing CO2/COX feed concentration. Therefore, the generation of
side products is not considered in this work.

2.4. Process Analysis and Optimization
Considering the Ô¨Åxed methanol production of 145 ton¬∑h‚àí1 or 1257.1 mol¬∑s‚àí1 and the
99.5% mol/mol purity of the reactants, the minimum required feed is 1263.4 mol¬∑s‚àí1 of
CO2 and 3790.3 mol¬∑s‚àí1 of H2, totalizing
.n f eed,min = 5053.7 mol¬∑s‚àí1. Since there are reactant
losses in the purge and product streams, an excess of feed is required. With a Ô¨Åx feed ratio
H2:CO2 of 3:1, the excess of feed (Exc) is deÔ¨Åned here as:
Exc =
ÔøΩ .n f eed ‚àí
.n f eed,min
ÔøΩ
.n f eed,min
¬∑100%
(12)
It is, of course, of interest to minimize feed consumption, due to its high costs. Feed
consumption is affected by key variables, such as reactor temperature and pressure, the
number of reactor modules (which deÔ¨Ånes the total catalyst mass), and purge fraction.
Avoiding large recycle streams is also important, as compressor work is required to get
the pressure back to 70 bar, and larger equipment (i.e., heat exchangers, Ô¨Çash drums,
compressors) are required to process higher Ô¨Çows.
Simulations were performed for a different number of reactor modules (from 3 to 12)
and different purge fractions (from 0.5 to 5%). For each case, an initial guess for the feed
excess was given (Exc = 5%), and a Ô¨Åx feed ratio H2:CO2 of 3:1 (a stoichiometric ratio) was
applied. Then, an optimization problem was solved in Matlab with the function fminsearch
(function tolerance = 0.1 mol¬∑s‚àí1, step tolerance = 0.1 ‚ó¶C), whose objective was to maximize
methanol production by varying the reactor coolant temperature (Tw).
With the optimum Tw, the required excess of feed was calculated to meet the methanol
demand (1257.1 mol¬∑s‚àí1) with Newton‚Äôs method (function tolerance: 0.1 mol¬∑s‚àí1). The
steps of the temperature optimization and Exc calculations were repeated until the temper-
ature update was lower than 0.25 ‚ó¶C.
2.5. Detailed Plant Simulation in Aspen Plus
After analyzing the results of the Matlab simulations, optimum parameters were
selected for each approach (i.e., the number of reactor modules, purge fraction, cooling Ô¨Çuid
temperature) and a detailed plant simulation including heat integration was implemented
in Aspen Plus V10.
The Peng‚ÄìRobinson property method was selected for the reactor modules. All other
equipment were simulated with the Non-Random Two-Liquid Model with a second set of
binary parameters (NRTL2) as the property method.
The methanol synthesis reactor was simulated with the rigorous plug Ô¨Çow reactor
model (RPLUG unit) and the kinetics described in Section 2.3 were implemented as a
Langmuir‚ÄìHinshelwood‚ÄìHougen‚ÄìWatson (LHHW) reaction model. The rearrangement
of the model parameters to follow the software‚Äôs speciÔ¨Åc input format is detailed in the
Supplementary Material (Section D). Since the reactor cooling Ô¨Çuid is at a constant tem-
perature due to water evaporation, both co-current and counter-current operations give
Processes 2022, 10, 1535
10 of 24
the same results. Therefore, the co-current operation was selected in order to simplify the
mathematical calculations.
The combustion of the purge streams in a Ô¨Åred heater was simulated with the RGIBBS
unit, which considers that chemical equilibrium is achieved when the free Gibbs energy of
the system is minimized.
The heat exchangers were simulated in counter-current Ô¨Çow with the HeatX unit, with
a minimum temperature approach of 25 ‚ó¶C for the heat exchangers located inside the Ô¨Åred
heater and a minimum temperature approach of 10 ‚ó¶C for all the other heat exchangers.
The compressors were modeled using the ASME method, assuming a mechanical
efÔ¨Åciency of 0.95 and an isentropic efÔ¨Åciency of 0.80 [22]. The pump was simulated assum-
ing an efÔ¨Åciency of 0.70. The turbine was simulated with the ASME method, assuming a
mechanical efÔ¨Åciency of 0.95 and an isentropic efÔ¨Åciency of 0.90 [52].
The distillation column was simulated with the rigorous RadFrac model, considering a
kettle reboiler and a partial condenser at 53 ‚ó¶C with liquid and vapor distillate. A Murphree
efÔ¨Åciency of 0.75 was set to all intermediate stages [53,54]. In both processes, the column
had 30 stages and a reÔ¨Çux ratio of 2, with the feed entering above the 24th stage.
The relative tolerance of all equipment calculations was set to 10‚àí5. Flowsheet conver-
gence was achieved using the Broyden method, with a relative tolerance of 10‚àí4, which
corresponds to a mass balance closure of 99.99%.
2.6. EfÔ¨Åciency Evaluation
The chemical conversion efÔ¨Åciency (Œ∑CCE) accounts for how much fuel energy remains
in the Ô¨Ånal product in relation to the reactants. For methanol synthesis from H2/CO2, it is
calculated as follows: [55]
Œ∑CCE =
.mMeOH¬∑LHVMeOH
.mH2¬∑LHVH2
(13)
where
.mMeOH is the methanol mass production,
.mH2 is the hydrogen feed demand, and
LHV is the low heating value. The maximum possible efÔ¨Åciency (Œ∑CCE,max) occurs at 100%
overall H2 conversion to methanol (stoichiometric conversion):
Œ∑CCE,max = MMeOH ¬∑LHVMeOH
3¬∑MH2¬∑LHVH2
= 0.876
(14)
Here, Mj is the molar mass of component j. In order to also account for heat and the
work input, the exergy efÔ¨Åciency (Œ∑Ex) is calculated: [39]
Œ∑Ex =
.mMeOH¬∑eMeOH
.mH2¬∑eH2 +
.mCO2¬∑eCO2 + Pel + EQ
(15)
where ej is the speciÔ¨Åc exergy of component j, Pel is the total required electric power, and
EQ is the total exergy input associated with heat demand.
The specific exergy of a component (ej) is divided between thermal and chemical exergy: [39]
ej(T, p) =
ÔøΩ
ej,therm
ÔøΩ
+ ej,chem =
ÔøΩ
Hj ‚àí Sj¬∑T0 ‚àí H0
j + S0
j ¬∑T0
ÔøΩ
+ HHVj
(16)
Here, ej,therm and ej,chem are the thermal and chemical exergies, Hj is enthalpy, Sj is
entropy, H0
j and S0
j are the enthalpy and entropy at reference conditions (298.15 K and 1 bar),
T0 is the reference temperature, and HHVj is the high heating value. In the exergy efÔ¨Åciency
calculation, the HHV is used instead of the LHV, as water is liquid at reference conditions.
2.7. Techno-Economic Evaluation
In order to calculate the production costs, the standardized methodology from
Albrecht et al. [56] was considered, which is a further development based on the work
of Peters et al. [57].
Processes 2022, 10, 1535

The main equipment costs (EC) were estimated based on reference equipment costs [57,58].
The scale up to the required capacity was performed with speciÔ¨Åc equipment scaling factors,
and price inÔ¨Çation was corrected to 2020 with the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Indexes
(CEPCI). In Equation (23), the costs of equipment j (ECj) is described:

(17)
Here, the subscription ref relates to the reference equipment, C is the characteristic
capacity, and M is the equipment scaling factor. The equipment is constructed with carbon
steel. When the reference price is in US dollars (USD), a conversion to euros (EUR) of
1.13 USD¬∑EUR‚àí1 is applied (February 2022) [59].
The dimensions of the flash drums and the packed distillation column were calculated
with the methodology reported by Towler and Sinnott [60]. The required heat transfer area of
the heat exchangers, column condenser, and reboiler were estimated by assuming the typical
global heat transfer coefficients reported by the VDI Atlas [43], according to each specific
situation. Equipment dimensioning is detailed in the Supplementary Material (Section G).
The Ô¨Åxed capital investment (FCI) was estimated by multiplying the total EC with the
Lang Factor (LF), which accounts for all direct and indirect costs related to the plant
construction.
In this work, LF was assumed to be 4.86 (details are provided in the
Supplementary Material, Section H) [56,57]. A working capital (WC) of 10% of the total
capital expenses (CAPEX) was considered [56]. Summarizing the equations:
FCI = LF¬∑‚àë ECj
(18)
CAPEX = FCI + WC
(19)
WC = 0.10¬∑CAPEX
(20)
The equivalent annual capital costs (ACC) were estimated by applying the annuity
method on the FCI, assuming an annual interest rate (IR) of 10%, a plant operating life (tP)
of 20 years, and no salvage value [61]. The working capital does not depreciate in value,
and only its interest has to be taken into account [56].
ACCFCI = FCI¬∑IR¬∑(1 + IR)tP
[(1 + IR)tP ‚àí 1]
(21)
ACCWC = WC¬∑IR
(22)
ACC = ACCFCI + ACCWC = FCI¬∑IR¬∑(1 + IR)tP
[(1 + IR)tP ‚àí 1]
+ WC¬∑IR
(23)
The operating expenses (OPEX) were divided between direct and indirect costs. The
costs related to the direct OPEX (OPEXdir) are presented in Table 2, which include raw
materials, catalysts, process water treating, and electricity. A catalyst lifetime of three years
was considered. In the Rankine water cycle, a clean water replacement of 1% of the total
Ô¨Çow was considered [62].
The indirect OPEX consisted of operating labor (OL), operating supervision, mainte-
nance, operating supplies, laboratory charges, taxes on property, insurance, plant overhead,
administration, distribution, marketing, research, and development. The estimation of each
of these items was based on typical values, which are dependent on OL, FCI, and the net
production costs (NPC) (see Section H of the Supplementary Material) [56,57]. The total
indirect OPEX (OPEXind) is calculated as follows:
OPEXind = 2.2125¬∑OL + 0.081¬∑FCI + 0.10¬∑NPC

The required number of operators in a shift (nOP) was estimated with the following
equation: [65,66]
nOP = (6.29 + 0.23¬∑Nnp)0.5
(25)
where Nnp is the number of non-particulate main processing units. Considering daily
working shifts, resting periods and vacations, the number of operators to fulÔ¨Åll each
position in a continuous operation is approximately FOP = 4.5. Therefore, the total number
of operators (NOP) is: [65,66]
NOP = FOP¬∑nOP
(26)
The total costs of operating labor (OL) is then calculated as follows:
OL = WOP ¬∑ NOP
(27)
where WOP is the wage rate of each operator (WOP = 72,000 ‚Ç¨¬∑a‚àí1) [53].

3. Results and Discussion
In this section, process simulation and analysis are presented separately for the one-
step and the three-step approaches. Finally, the techno-economic analysis of both ap-
proaches is presented and discussed jointly.
3.1. One-Step Process
3.1.1. One-Step Process‚ÄîSelecting Key Parameters
The one-step process was successfully implemented in Matlab. Different scenarios
were simulated by varying the number of reactor modules and the purge fraction, with
the optimal temperature for a Ô¨Åxed methanol production (145 ton¬∑h‚àí1) being estimated
in each case. In Figure 5, several contour plots are shown, where CO2 single-pass conver-
sion (XCO2,SP) (Figure 5a), the required feed excess (Figure 5b), the optimal temperature
(Figure 5c), and the total recycle stream (Figure 5d) are plotted against the number of reactor
modules and the purge fraction.
CO2 single-pass conversion (Figure 5a) was considerably enhanced by increasing
the number of reactor modules. This was not only because the gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) decreased, but also because the optimal temperature had lower values (Figure 5c),
shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium towards higher methanol concentrations. In
contrast, reducing the purge fraction had little effect on XCO2,SP. This should be the result
of two competing effects: on one hand, a lower purge fraction means higher recycle
streams (Figure 5d), which increases the GHSV, reducing XCO2,SP. On the other hand, the
recycle stream has a H2:CO2 ratio greater than three due to a limited rWGSR extension.
Processes 2022, 10, 1535

By increasing the recycle stream, the H2:CO2 ratio of the reactor feed stream is enhanced,
positively contributing to XCO2,SP.

purge fraction. 
3.1.2. One-Step Process‚ÄîDetailed Plant Simulation and Process Analysis 
A detailed flowsheet of the one-step process presented in Figure 3 was implemented 
in Aspen Plus, considering 2% purge fraction, six reactor modules working in parallel, 
and the optimized temperature of the reactor cooling fluid (ùëáÔøΩ = 247.5 ¬∞C). A picture of 
the flowsheet in Aspen Plus, the properties of the streams, and a detailed plant description 
are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section E). 
In Figure 6, the concentration of the products along the reactor length is shown. The 
methanol and water feed concentrations were close to zero, and their outlet concentrations 
were 7.4 and 7.2% mol/mol, respectively. The nitrogen concentration remained relatively 
low (inlet: 4.95% mol/mol, outlet: 5.65% mol/mol). Due to the recycle streams, CO entered 
the reactor modules at 1.50% mol/mol, although it was not a feedstock in the plant. CO 
was produced through the rWGSR until the length of 1.5 m, where its concentration 
reached 3.3% mol/mol. Then, due to the high water concentration (4.30% mol/mol), the 
WGSR became faster than its reverse reaction and started to consume CO, which exited 
the reactor at 1.76% mol/mol and a marginal selectivity (0.5%). This virtually stabilized 
CO content in the plant led to a high methanol selectivity (99.5%). 
Figure 5. One-step process‚ÄîCO2 single-pass conversion (a), required feed excess (b), optimal
temperature (c), and total recycle stream (d) as a function of the number of reactor modules and the
purge fraction.
The required feed excess was signiÔ¨Åcantly decreased both by increasing the number
of reactor modules and by reducing the purge fraction. This occurred because the former
procedure increased XCO2,SP and the latter maintained XCO2,SP roughly constant while
increasing the gas Ô¨Çow inside the reactor modules.
Since the reactants (H2, CO2) represent the highest costs of the plant, it is important to
minimize the required feed excess, which according to Figure 5b, occurred at 0.5% purge
fraction. However, with such a low purge fraction, the total recycle stream was considerably
high, demanding larger heat exchangers, Ô¨Çash drums, and compressors, as well as higher
power consumption. Therefore, an intermediate value of 2% as the purge fraction was
selected for the detailed simulation in Aspen Plus, agreeing with other studies and typical
industrial values [22,39,58].
With the purge fraction Ô¨Åxed at 2%, six reactor modules were used in the detailed
study, because further increasing the number of reactor modules only slightly reduced the
required excess feed, not justifying further expenses in equipment and catalyst.
The value of the global heat transfer coefficient was updated point by point within mathe-
matical integration along the reactor length. For the selected condition, Uz=0 = 160 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1

and Uz=12.5 = 150 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1. Since Aspen Plus requires a constant value, the average
value was used (Uavg = 155 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1).
3.1.2. One-Step Process‚ÄîDetailed Plant Simulation and Process Analysis
A detailed Ô¨Çowsheet of the one-step process presented in Figure 3 was implemented
in Aspen Plus, considering 2% purge fraction, six reactor modules working in parallel, and
the optimized temperature of the reactor cooling Ô¨Çuid (Tw = 247.5 ‚ó¶C). A picture of the
Ô¨Çowsheet in Aspen Plus, the properties of the streams, and a detailed plant description are
provided in the Supplementary Material (Section E).
In Figure 6, the concentration of the products along the reactor length is shown. The
methanol and water feed concentrations were close to zero, and their outlet concentrations
were 7.4 and 7.2% mol/mol, respectively. The nitrogen concentration remained relatively
low (inlet: 4.95% mol/mol, outlet: 5.65% mol/mol). Due to the recycle streams, CO entered
the reactor modules at 1.50% mol/mol, although it was not a feedstock in the plant. CO was
produced through the rWGSR until the length of 1.5 m, where its concentration reached
3.3% mol/mol. Then, due to the high water concentration (4.30% mol/mol), the WGSR
became faster than its reverse reaction and started to consume CO, which exited the reactor
at 1.76% mol/mol and a marginal selectivity (0.5%). This virtually stabilized CO content in
the plant led to a high methanol selectivity (99.5%).

Figure 6. One-step process‚Äîproduct concentration along the reactor length. Reactor feed 
concentration: H2/CO/CO2/CH3OH/H2O/N2 = 71.3/1.5/21.9/0.3/0.0/5.0% mol/mol. 
The CO2 single-pass conversion was 28.5%, close to the equilibrium conversion 
(30.4%), while the feed excess was 6.05%, which corresponded to an overall CO2 
conversion to methanol of 94.3%. These values are in agreement with the Matlab 
simulations (ùëãÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ,ÔøΩÔøΩ = 29.7%, feed excess = 5.75%, overall CO2 conversion to MeOH 
= 94.6%). 
The chemical conversion efficiency (ùúÇÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ) of the process was 82.6%, which was 
close to the maximum possible value (ùúÇÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ,ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ = 87.6%). With the heat integration, 
the one-step process was not only self-sufficient, but had a heat excess that could 
be supplied to other processes, in agreement with the literature [21,39]. In our case, 
as is commonly performed in industrial methanol synthesis plants, the heat excess 
was used to generate electricity via a water Rankine cycle, reducing the electricity 
consumption from 47.4 to 17.6 MW. 
In Figure 7, a global exergy balance and an exergy loss distribution are 
provided. No distinction was made between exergy destruction and exergy losses 
via side output streams (i.e., cooling water, process water, and flue gas). The exergy 
efficiency (ùúÇÔøΩÔøΩ) of the process was 76.4%, with a total exergy loss of 281.9 MW. The 
main losses occurred due to the exothermic chemical reactions with heat recovery 
at low temperatures (reactor modules: 58.1%, fired heater: 14.8%). Additionally, 
exergy losses in the heat exchangers (11.1%) and in the column (9.0%) were also 
significant, mainly due to heat transfer to cooling water.

(XCO2,SP = 29.7%, feed excess = 5.75%, overall CO2 conversion to MeOH = 94.6%).
The chemical conversion efÔ¨Åciency (Œ∑CCE) of the process was 82.6%, which was close
to the maximum possible value (Œ∑CCE,max = 87.6%). With the heat integration, the one-step
process was not only self-sufÔ¨Åcient, but had a heat excess that could be supplied to other
processes, in agreement with the literature [21,39]. In our case, as is commonly performed
in industrial methanol synthesis plants, the heat excess was used to generate electricity via
a water Rankine cycle, reducing the electricity consumption from 47.4 to 17.6 MW.
In Figure 7, a global exergy balance and an exergy loss distribution are provided.
No distinction was made between exergy destruction and exergy losses via side output
streams (i.e., cooling water, process water, and Ô¨Çue gas). The exergy efÔ¨Åciency (Œ∑Ex) of the

the exothermic chemical reactions with heat recovery at low temperatures (reactor modules:
58.1%, Ô¨Åred heater: 14.8%). Additionally, exergy losses in the heat exchangers (11.1%) and
in the column (9.0%) were also signiÔ¨Åcant, mainly due to heat transfer to cooling water.

The three-step process was successfully implemented in Matlab. In Figure 8, CO2
single-pass conversion (XCO2,SP) (Figure 8a), the required feed excess (Figure 8b), the
optimal temperature (Figure 8c), and the total recycle stream (Figure 8d) are described as
a function of the number of reactor modules and the purge fraction. Since this process
considers three reaction steps with intermediate cooling, the simulations were limited to
multiples of three as the total number of reactor modules.

A signiÔ¨Åcant improvement was seen in the three-step process in relation to the one-step
approach. For similar conditions (i.e., the same total number of reactor modules and purge
stream fraction), CO2 single-pass conversion had approximately doubled, the required
feed excess decreased by 60‚Äì70%, and the total recycle stream decreased by 50‚Äì70%. The
optimal values for the reactor cooling Ô¨Çuid remained close to the ones of the Ô¨Årst approach
(between 230 and 260 ‚ó¶C).
Similarly to the one-step process, a purge fraction equal to 2% was chosen here, having
a good compromise between minimizing the feed requirements and minimizing the total
recycle stream. With this Ô¨Åxed purge fraction, a number of reactor modules equal to three
was selected, as further increasing this amount gave limited improvement in the required
feed excess and the total recycle stream, while considerably increasing equipment and
catalyst costs.
When analyzing different scenarios in Matlab, the same cooling Ô¨Çuid temperature
(Tw) was considered for all reactors. A further optimization was possible by allowing this
temperature to be independently operated in each reactor. This possibility was checked
for the chosen condition (2% purge fraction, three reactor modules), but only a marginal
improvement was obtained (see Table 3), probably not justifying the increase in plant
complexity. Therefore, in the detailed analysis, the cooling Ô¨Çuid temperature of all the
reactors was set to 258.5 ‚ó¶C.

Similarly to the one-step process, the average heat transfer coefÔ¨Åcients were obtained
for each reactor and given to Aspen Plus: U1 = 327 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1, U2 = 285 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1,
U3 = 246 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1. The decrease in the coefÔ¨Åcient values is associated with a decrease
in total Ô¨Çow, due to intermediate product removal. Still, the heat transfer coefÔ¨Åcients were
higher than in the one-step process (155 W¬∑m‚àí2¬∑K‚àí1), which had lower Ô¨Çows for each
reactor module because of parallel operation.
3.2.2. Three-Step Process‚ÄîDetailed Plant Simulation and Process Analysis
A detailed Ô¨Çowsheet of the three-step process presented in Figure 4 was implemented
in Aspen Plus, considering a 2% purge fraction, three reactor modules working in series
with intermediate product condensation, and the previously optimized temperature of the
reactor cooling Ô¨Çuid (Tw = 258.5 ‚ó¶C). A detailed plant description, stream properties, and a
picture of the flowsheet in Aspen Plus are provided in the Supplementary Material (Section F).
In Figure 9, the concentration of the products along the length of the three reactors is
shown, as well as the product removal through the intermediate condensation steps. In
Reactor 1, CO entered at a low concentration (1.3% mol/mol), peaked at z = 2.5 m, and
left the reactor with a higher concentration (2.7% mol/mol). This CO production through
the rWGSR increased the water concentration (yR1,out
H2O
= 5.6% mol/mol) and slowed down
methanol production (yR1,out
MeOH = 4.7% mol/mol).
In Reactors 2 and 3, the CO inlet concentration was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher (3.0% mol/mol
for both cases), causing its concentration peak to come much sooner (at 1.8 m and 1.25 m,
respectively). After that, the WGSR was faster than its reverse reaction and the CO con-
centration decreased, leaving both reactors with an overall positive CO consumption.
Therefore, the water concentration in Reactors 2 and 3 was maintained at lower levels
(yR2,out
H2O
= 4.7% mol/mol, yR3,out
H2O
= 4.5% mol/mol), enhancing the Ô¨Ånal methanol concentra-
tion (yR2,out
MeOH = 5.6% mol/mol, yR3,out
MeOH = 5.8% mol/mol).

The methanol production was similar in Reactors 1 and 2 (1616 and 1589 kmol¬∑h‚àí1, 
respectively), while it was 18% lower in Reactor 3 (1325 kmol¬∑h‚àí1). This shows the positive 
effect of a higher CO concentration in the reactor feed, despite the lower total feed flow 
and CO2 inlet concentration of Reactors 2 and 3 in relation to Reactor 1. 
The CO2 single-pass conversion (ùëãÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ,ÔøΩÔøΩ) was 53.9%, with a selectivity to methanol 
of 99.8% and a selectivity to CO of 0.2%. The feed excess was 2.35%, leading to an overall

The three-step approach was significantly superior to the one-step process, even 
using only half the number of reactor modules (three vs. six). This superiority is clear

The methanol production was similar in Reactors 1 and 2 (1616 and 1589 kmol¬∑h‚àí1,
respectively), while it was 18% lower in Reactor 3 (1325 kmol¬∑h‚àí1). This shows the positive
effect of a higher CO concentration in the reactor feed, despite the lower total feed Ô¨Çow
and CO2 inlet concentration of Reactors 2 and 3 in relation to Reactor 1.
The CO2 single-pass conversion (XCO2,SP) was 53.9%, with a selectivity to methanol
of 99.8% and a selectivity to CO of 0.2%. The feed excess was 2.35%, leading to an overall
conversion of CO2 to methanol of 97.7%. These values are in agreement with the Matlab
simulations (XCO2,SP = 54.1%, Exc = 2.42%, overall CO2 conversion to MeOH = 97.6%).
The three-step approach was signiÔ¨Åcantly superior to the one-step process, even using
only half the number of reactor modules (three vs. six). This superiority is clear when
Processes 2022, 10, 1535

looking at the CO2 single-pass conversion (53.9% vs. 28.5%), leading to a considerably
higher overall conversion to methanol (97.7% vs. 94.3%).
With the heat integration, the three-step process was also self-sufÔ¨Åcient in heat, while
electricity was produced through a water Rankine cycle, reducing the total power consump-
tion from 42.7 to 21.8 MW. The chemical conversion efÔ¨Åciency was Œ∑3s
CCE = 85.6%, which
was higher than the value of the one-step process (Œ∑1s
CCE = 82.3%) and, therefore, even closer
to the maximum possible value (Œ∑CCE,max = 87.6%).
In Figure 10, an exergy analysis of the process is presented. The exergy efÔ¨Åciency
was Œ∑3s
Ex = 78.8%, an improvement from the previous approach (Œ∑1s
Ex = 76.4%), with the
total exergy losses decreasing in 13% (245.3 vs. 281.9 MW). Although the total power
consumption decreased (42.7 vs. 47.4 MW), the net power consumption increased slightly
(21.8 vs. 17.6 MW). This occurred because power generation was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower in the
three-step approach (20.8 vs. 29.8 MW) due to the much lower heat duty of the Ô¨Åred heater,
as less reactant was lost in the purge streams.

heater, as less reactant was lost in the purge streams.

Both processes lost approximately the same exergy in the reactor modules and the

(29.4 vs. 31.4 MW). Finally, moderate improvements were also seen in the compressors and

In Figure 11a, the distribution of the equipment costs (EC) is presented, with the
reactor modules and the compressors representing the majority of the costs (&gt;75%). The
total EC was 85.5 and 66.1 M‚Ç¨ for the one-step and the three-step approach, respectively.
This signiÔ¨Åcant improvement of the three-step process was a consequence of the inter-
mediate condensation steps, requiring a lower total reactor volume (due to an enhanced
reaction velocity), lower compressor size (due to a lower recycle Ô¨Çow), and lower fur-
nace, turbine, and generator size (due to a lower purge Ô¨Çow). The cost reduction in the
aforementioned equipment was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the additional costs of the heat
exchangers and Ô¨Çash drums from the intermediate condensation units. The total Ô¨Åxed
capital investment (FCI) was 415.9 and 321.4 M‚Ç¨ for the one-step and three-step approach,
respectively. The detailed estimated capacity and price of each equipment is presented in

operating costs were the reactant expenses (78‚Äì80% of NPC), with ACC contributing with
only 4‚Äì5%, while the catalysts and electricity consisted of less than 3% of the NPC. Due
to the higher overall CO2 conversion to methanol, the NPC of the three-step process was
5.7% lower than the one-step approach. The detailed OPEX costs are presented in the
Supplementary Material (Section H).
In Table 7, a summary of the overall costs is presented. The NPC was 920 and 868
‚Ç¨¬∑ton‚àí1 for the one-step and the three-step process, respectively, corresponding to an
improvement of 5.7% for the new process. Besides the hydrogen and carbon dioxide costs,
the Ô¨Åxed capital investment (FCI) and the discount rate were the most sensitive parameters
to the methanol selling price, as shown in the tornado analysis (see Figure 12).

4. Conclusions 
A detailed study of a methanol synthesis plant from H2 and CO2 with intermediate 
condensation units (the three-step process) is presented and compared with the 
conventional approach (the one-step process). The total production was fixed at 1.16 Mton 
MeOH¬∑a‚àí1. The processes were first implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze 
the number of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the reactor operating temperature. 
Using the most suitable process parameters, detailed plants of both approaches were 
implemented in Aspen Plus, including heat integration and a water Rankine cycle to make 
use of the reaction enthalpy. Finally, techno-economic analyses were applied. Both 
processes offered an excess of heat, which was used to generate electricity in our work, 
but could alternatively supply other plants (e.g., CCU, OME synthesis) in a larger process 
integration. 
It was demonstrated that CO2 single-pass conversion almost doubled when including 
intermediate condensation steps (53.9 vs. 28.5%), resulting in a significantly higher overall 
conversion to methanol (97.7 vs. 94.3%) and in a higher exergy efficiency (78.8 vs. 76.4%). 
Because of the enhanced conversion, the new process required lower recycle and feed 
streams, decreasing net production costs by 61.2 M‚Ç¨¬∑a‚àí1 (5.7%). Although additional 
equipment (i.e., heat exchangers and gas‚Äìliquid separators) is necessary, the improved 
process was significantly more efficient than the conventional approach, requiring lower 
sizes of the main equipment (e.g., compressors, reactors, fired heater). Consequently, 
according to our analysis, the total investment costs were 94.5 M‚Ç¨ (22.7%) lower than for

4. Conclusions
A detailed study of a methanol synthesis plant from H2 and CO2 with intermediate con-
densation units (the three-step process) is presented and compared with the conventional
approach (the one-step process). The total production was Ô¨Åxed at 1.16 Mton MeOH¬∑a‚àí1.
The processes were Ô¨Årst implemented in Matlab in order to critically analyze the number
of reactor modules, the purge fraction, and the reactor operating temperature. Using the
most suitable process parameters, detailed plants of both approaches were implemented
in Aspen Plus, including heat integration and a water Rankine cycle to make use of the
reaction enthalpy. Finally, techno-economic analyses were applied. Both processes offered
an excess of heat, which was used to generate electricity in our work, but could alternatively
supply other plants (e.g., CCU, OME synthesis) in a larger process integration.
It was demonstrated that CO2 single-pass conversion almost doubled when including
intermediate condensation steps (53.9 vs. 28.5%), resulting in a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher overall
conversion to methanol (97.7 vs. 94.3%) and in a higher exergy efÔ¨Åciency (78.8 vs. 76.4%).
Because of the enhanced conversion, the new process required lower recycle and feed
streams, decreasing net production costs by 61.2 M‚Ç¨¬∑a‚àí1 (5.7%). Although additional
equipment (i.e., heat exchangers and gas‚Äìliquid separators) is necessary, the improved
Processes 2022, 10, 1535

process was signiÔ¨Åcantly more efÔ¨Åcient than the conventional approach, requiring lower
sizes of the main equipment (e.g., compressors, reactors, Ô¨Åred heater). Consequently,
according to our analysis, the total investment costs were 94.5 M‚Ç¨ (22.7%) lower than for
the conventional process.
Intermediate condensation steps are therefore highly recommended for methanol
production from H2/CO2, reducing costs by improving CO2 equilibrium conversion to
methanol while using commercially proven technology. Besides, since water accelerates the
deactivation of Cu-based catalysts, product intermediate removal should increase catalyst
lifetime, as the average water concentration in the reactor is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than in the
conventional process.
With our proposed process, the methanol net production costs amounted to 868 ‚Ç¨¬∑ton‚àí1,
which are still signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than the current market price (495 ‚Ç¨¬∑ton‚àí1) but is believed
to become economically viable with an effective reduction in the price of green hydrogen.
