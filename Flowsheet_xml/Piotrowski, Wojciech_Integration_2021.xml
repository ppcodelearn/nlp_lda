Abstract: The paper presents a study on the performance of a conventional plant-producing ethyl
acetate from ethanol and acetic acid. Process models were compiled in the simulator Chemcad 7.
The impact of key parameters on the performance of individual installation nodes was examined
by sensitivity analysis. Three installation approaches are presented and compared: two classic with
different heat duties and an improved one. An improved technological solution, with a closed
circulation of the extractant as well as the azeotrope subcooling for better extraction is demonstrated.
The energy and mass balance of the installation were developed. The proposed enhancement of
a technology with signiﬁcantly reduced consumption of the fresh extractant also offers a deep
recovery of the raw materials, i.e., ethyl acetate and ethanol from wastewater. We assumed that
the same energy consumption relative to the classic strategy consumption of ethanol was reduced
from 0.531 to 0.524 t/tproduct (−1.2%), fresh process water from 2.18 to 1.42 t/tproduct (−34.9%), and
wastewater 2.36 to 1.61 t/tproduct (−31.8%). By this, the wastewater total organic loading (TOL), as
well as chemical oxygen demand were nine times reduced. The major advantage is achieved through
subcooling of azeotrope, which improves extraction efﬁciency, making the organic phase enriched
with ethyl acetate. Therefore, the performance of the product separation node and the whole system
are improved.

1. Introduction
Solvents, such as ethyl acetate, are the substances used in many industrial processes,
including the chemical industry. Due to their wide range of application, world demand for
solvents is constantly growing [1–3]. Increasingly stringent regulations on emissions of
harmful pollutants from production processes make the importance of so called “green
chemistry” (non-toxic chemicals to the environment and living organisms) well recog-
nized [4]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for commonly used solvents to have a lower
health and environmental impact. Ethyl acetate is characterized by low toxicity and, impor-
tantly, it is biodegradable. These advantageous features caused a signiﬁcant increase in the
market demand for this product of “green chemistry”. On the other hand, a sustainable de-
velopment and good engineering practice are the drivers towards a lowered consumption
of energy and utilities, as well as a reduced wastes production—an economy of the closed
cycle. A technology improvement presented herein responds to all these environmental
and economy requirements.
In order to minimize the losses of raw materials and the consumption of auxiliary
media, it is necessary to optimize the technology. This will both improve the economy
of the process and minimize the environmental impact by reducing pollutant emissions.
Our improved variant of the classic ethyl acetate plant includes additional subcooling of
azeotrope, which improves extraction efﬁciency, making the organic phase enriched with
ethyl acetate. This increases the efﬁciency of the other installation units, and reduces the

heat duty of the plant and the emission of pollutants. A closed circulation of the extractant
was also applied, which contributes to reducing the amount of wastewater.
1.1. Synthesis Methods
Ethyl acetate (EA) in the chemical industry is obtained mainly by the classic Fischer
esteriﬁcation reaction, where the substrates are ethanol (ET) and acetic acid (AA), and
water (W) is a by-product of the reaction [5].
Esters, including ethyl acetate, can also be synthesized in a number of other reactions
using compounds such as acid anhydrides, acid chlorides, amides, nitriles, unsaturated
hydrocarbons, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and other esters (transesteriﬁcation
reaction) [6]. However, due to the relatively high price of raw materials and the possibility
of undesired by-products forming by these pathways of alternative synthesis, the classic
Fischer esteriﬁcation is found to be the most commonly used reaction for the EA synthesis.
The Fischer reaction of esteriﬁcation of alcohols with carboxylic acids is carried out at
elevated temperatures, in the presence of catalysts. Both homogenous and heterogeneous
catalysts are employed [7]. The former are usually inorganic acids such as sulfuric and
phosphoric acid, and hydrochloric acid, while the latter include acidic ion exchange resins.
In the presence of the mentioned catalysts, the ethyl acetate synthesis is carried out under
the temperature ranging between 70–90 ◦C. The temperature of the reaction mixture is
controlled at a level assuring efﬁcient removal of the vapors of the lighter key product in
the esteriﬁcation reaction [8].
The reaction of liquid phase esteriﬁcation is reversible and insigniﬁcantly exothermic.
The value of the equilibrium constant of the reaction depends primarily on the structure
of alcohol and acid. In the reaction of acetic acid with ethyl alcohol, the equilibrium
constant may vary in the range of 4–4.5, which corresponds to a conversion of 66–68% at a
stoichiometric ratio of substrates [8].
Ionic liquids can also be used as a catalyst for the reaction. In the esteriﬁcation process,
it is possible to carry out the reaction already at room temperature, while obtaining high
yields. Another advantage of using this type of catalyst is the fact that the reaction product
is eliminated from the reaction medium as a separate phase [9], thus shifting the reaction
equilibrium towards the product. The homogeneous catalyst, which is an ionic liquid, can
therefore be reused by returning it to the process after puriﬁcation [10,11]. Due to their
corrosiveness, ionic liquids are rarely used on an industrial scale to produce ethyl acetate.
The process can also take place in the steam phase. The catalysts are then oxides of
metals such as ZrO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, and the reaction is carried out at a temperature
that allows the evaporation of the reactants [12,13]. In the case of ethyl acetate, the conver-
sion rate of the reactants can be as high as 100%; however, depending on the catalyst used,
by-products may be formed [12,13].
An alternative method is the Tishchenko reaction, in which acetaldehyde dispropor-
tionates in the presence of base to the alcohol and the acid that then esterify in situ [14].
The most common catalyst of this reaction are aluminum alkoxides. In this reaction, the
obtainable yield of ethyl acetate by adding aluminum ethoxide to acetaldehyde at −20 ◦C
is 61% [15]. However, this method is less popular than the classical Fischer esteriﬁcation
due to the availability and price of the raw material [16].
There are also other methods of synthesis, such as ethanol dehydrogenation and
synthesis from ethylene and acetic acid. These methods require difﬁcult process conditions
(T &gt; 200 ◦C, p &gt; 20 bar), which signiﬁcantly increases the investment costs of the plant.
Selectivity of the ethyl acetate synthesis from ethylene and acetic acid is almost 100% [17],
but the efﬁciency of this process is not so high. Depending on the catalyst used, the
maximum achieved conversion degree of this process ranges between 40% [18] and 50% [5].
On the other hand, many by-products are formed in the ethanol dehydrogenation reaction
such as other esters, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The reaction mixture contains
components with boiling points similar to ethyl acetate, including components which
Processes 2021, 9, 1425

can form azeotropes [19]. This is a particular problem when high purity ethyl acetate is
desired [20].
Considering the advantages and disadvantages of individual methods, a classic Fis-
cher esteriﬁcation reaction was selected in the modeled installation.
1.2. Puriﬁcation Method
Distillation is one of the most common methods of separating components of liquid
mixtures. However, it is not always possible to separate a liquid mixture by simple
distillation. Separation of the EA–ET–W mixture is one of such cases [21]. Ethyl acetate
cannot be separated from water and ethanol by simple distillation, because a ternary
azeotrope consisting of: 83.1% ethyl acetate, 8.7% ethanol and 8.2% water, is formed [22].
Therefore, the separation of reaction products is far more complex, in this particular case.
The classic method of purifying the reaction mixture is a three-stage distillation in
combination with a water extraction process. There are also other methods used to purify
the reaction mixture such as extractive distillation and membrane methods.
Extractive distillation is a partial vaporization process in the presence of a non-volatile
separating agent with a high boiling point, which is generally called solvent or entrainer,
and which is added to the azeotropic mixture to alter the relative volatility of the key
component with no additional formation of azeotropes [23]. The principle driving extrac-
tive distillation is based on the introduction of a selective solvent that interacts differently
with each of the components of the original mixture and which generally shows a strong
afﬁnity with one of the key components [23]. The extraction agent after extractive dis-
tillation is puriﬁed in the recovery column and recycled to the process. Thanks to this
it can work in a closed circuit, which reduces the amount of generated waste [24]. Typi-
cal examples of effective agents used in extractive distillation in the puriﬁcation of ethyl
acetate are: dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerin and diethyl glycol, 1-naphthol, hydroquinone
and N,N-dimethylformamide [25]. Due to the complex nature of the reaction mixture, in
order to obtain a pure product, the extraction distillation has to be combined with another
method, e.g., a membrane method [22].
Membrane processes belong to a large group of techniques for separating the compo-
nents of liquid and gas mixtures. The membrane technique used to separate azeotropic
mixtures is called pervaporation [26].
Pervaporation membranes can be used to selectively separate water and ethyl acetate
to break down any azeotrope present. The energy consumption in this case is lower than
in the case of classical extraction with water [27].
Complete dehydration with membranes does not require a lot of energy, but leaves
a waste stream of 17 wt% ethyl acetate on the permeate side [28]. This waste stream
requires additional treatment. Therefore, the pervaporation process is combined with the
distillation process.
Both membrane methods and extractive distillation to produce a high purity product
require a combination with another method. This multiplies the disadvantages of the
selected methods. Therefore, the classic method of separating the reaction mixture by
distillation was chosen.
The puriﬁcation process in classical technology can be divided into three stages:
(1)
First is the process of rectifying the reaction mixture, i.e., stripping acetic acid by a
rectiﬁcation column and distilling the ethyl acetate–ethanol–water (EA–ET–W) ternary
azeotrope. In order to generate an azeotrope by the distillation of reaction products,
and to avoid accumulating water in the reactor, an azeotropic agent should be fed
to the column. By esteriﬁcation of the acetic acid with ethanol, some excess water
is released (approximately 17%) [29] which is more than contained in the azeotrope
mixture (approximately 7.8%). Therefore, the azeotropic agent is the organic phase in
the extraction process, recycled to the column. This fraction is richer in ethyl acetate
than the azeotrope (&gt;93%) [8], so it binds the excess water.

(2)
After azeotropic distillation, there is an extraction process. To obtain enriched phase
of ethyl acetate from the distillation product, it is necessary to wash it with water and
extract ethanol. The ethanol content of the organic mixture affects the solubility of
water in this phase. The higher is the content of alcohol, the greater the water content
in the organic phase. By extracting ethanol, water is also removed from the organic
phase [8].
(3)
The ﬁnal stage is the process of product rectiﬁcation. Enriched phase of ethyl acetate
is fed to the rectiﬁcation column, where, by distilling the triple azeotrope, a pure ethyl
acetate is obtained as the bottom product [8].
2. Methodology
In this study, the conventional process of ethyl acetate synthesis was considered [21].
Raw materials in this technology are acetic acid and anhydrous ethanol.
The main goal of this paper is to optimize the process conditions of synthesis and
puriﬁcation of ethyl acetate. A study was carried out based on a model built with the use
of ﬂowsheeting software Chemcad 7. The shame of the modeled installation is shown
in Figure 1.
Figure 1. The scheme of the installation modeled in the Chemcad 7. (Stream numbers in rectangular frames, equipment in
rounded frames.)
Acetic acid and ethanol are mixed (MIX 1, Figure 1), heated up (HTXR 2, Figure 1)
and directed to the reactor. The esteriﬁcation reaction takes place in the reactor–evaporator
(KREA 4, Figure 1) at a temperature of about 90 ◦C, under atmospheric pressure. The
vapors from the reactor (Stream 6, Figure 1) are directed to the column (SCDS 5, Figure 1),
in which unreacted acetic acid is separated from the product by azeotropic distillation—the
ﬁrst stage of EA puriﬁcation. The bottom product (Stream 7, Figure 1) is recycled to the
reactor–evaporator. The distillate (Stream 9, Figure 1) is a triple EA–ET– W azeotrope. The
azeotrope is washed with water (EXTR 8, Figure 1) to extract ethanol—the second stage of
EA puriﬁcation. In case of the improved approach, the extractor feed is cooled down to
enhance extraction—advantageous shift of extraction equilibrium (HTXR 6, Figure 1).
The organic phase from the extraction process is partly recycled (Stream 26, Figure 1)
to the azeotropic column (SCDS 5, Figure 1) as reﬂux, while the remainder (Stream 12,
Processes 2021, 9, 1425
5 of 16
Figure 1) is directed to the product rectiﬁcation column (SCDS 11, Figure 1)—ﬁnal product
distillation. In this column, pure ethyl acetate is obtained as the bottom product (Stream 16,
Figure 1), and the subcooled distillate (triple azeotrope) is recycled to the extraction process
(EXTR 8, Figure 1).
The aqueous phase after extraction (Stream 20, Figure 1), containing ethanol and ethyl
acetate is directed to the wastewater column (SCDS 15, Figure 1), where ethyl acetate and
ethanol are recovered. The distillate (Stream 21, Figure 1) is recycled to the reactor and
the bottom product (Stream 22, Figure 1) is recycled as a washing water to the extraction
process, partially refreshed with a fresh portion of water (Stream 17, Figure 1).
The impact of key parameters on the performance of individual installation nodes
was examined by sensitivity analysis. On the basis of the analysis, the optimal conditions
for the process were selected.
For comparison purposes, three installation approaches are presented:
Strategy 1 (S1): The improved technology of ethyl acetate synthesis differs from a
classic approach by the following:
-
a closed circuit of the extractant, demineralized water, reducing the consumption of
the fresh extractant, but also a deep recovery of raw materials, i.e., ethyl acetate and
ethanol from wastewater, signiﬁcantly reducing the TOL;
-
cooling the azeotrope before extraction (Streams 8 and 14, Figure 1) from 70 ◦C down
to 30 ◦C (HTXR 6, 12, Figure 1), shifting a phase equilibrium towards higher concen-
trations of EA in the organic phase, resulting in a reduced reﬂux on the azeotropic
column as well as the reduced ﬂowrate of the water phase directed to the wastewater
treatment plant.
Strategy 2 (S2): The classic approach with product (Stream 16, Figure 1) and wastew-
ater quality (Stream 25, Figure 1) maintained at a level comparable to case 1, resulting in
the increased heat duties applied by the reactor (KREA 4, Figure 1) as well as rectiﬁcation
columns (SCDS 11, 15, Figure 1).
Strategy 3 (S3): The classic approach with the product and wastewater quality, result-
ing from the heat duties by rectiﬁcation columns (SCDS 11, 15, Figure 1) equivalent to case
1, and the increased recycle of the azeotrope (Stream 27, Figure 1). The heat duty of the
reactor (KREA 4, Figure 1) is increased to maintain the conversion rate.
2.1. Thermodynamic Model
Numerous data sets regarding liquid–liquid and liquid–vapor equilibria for the ethyl
acetate–ethanol–acetic acid–water systems, are reported in the literature [30–35]. This
quaternary system exhibits non-ideal behavior with formation of azeotropes and with the
possibility of formation of two liquid phases. Calvar studied the liquid–vapor equilibria
for a system at atmospheric pressure [30]. He received a very good approximation of the
experimental data, using the UNIQUAC thermodynamic model. Arce, in his work [31]
studied the liquid–liquid equilibria. He also acheived the best ﬁt using the UNIQUAC
model. Therefore, for the modeling of either liquid–vapor or liquid–liquid equilibria, the
UNIQUAC model is used in the modelling exercise.
2.2. Kinetics of Esteriﬁcation Reaction
The kinetics of the esteriﬁcation reaction is also a subject of numerous studies [36–39].
Atalay [36] determined the activation energies and coefﬁcients of the classic Arrhenius
equation in the reaction of acetic acid esteriﬁcation with ethanol, where sulfuric acid (VI)
was used as a homogenous catalyst. He also studied the effect of catalyst concentration,
temperature and the ratio of substrate concentrations on the reaction kinetics.
According to Atalay, the best ﬁt of the experimental data is offered by the reaction rate
described with the following equation:
rA = k1CK0.5CA0.5 − k2CWCE,

where:
k1 = 2.145exp(−13,494/(RT)) [1/min]
(2)
k2 = 0.0545 exp(−9314/(RT)) [1/min]
(3)
3. Results
3.1. Optimization of the Reaction System
The continuous stirred tank reactor CSTR was used to model the reaction system
(KREA 4, Figure 1). The key parameters affecting the degree of conversion are the tem-
perature and the residence time of the reaction mixture in the reactor. The inﬂuence of
these parameters on the composition of the post-reaction mixture was examined using the
sensitivity analysis tool. The analysis assumed a constant composition of the reactor input
stream. The results of the analysis are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Inﬂuence of temperature and residence time on the conversion in the reactor.
The results obtained by simulation prove that the temperature increase in the reactor
positively affects the EA content in the output stream, but only up to a certain point. The
highest degree of reagent conversion was obtained at 85 ◦C. Above 85 ◦C, the EA content
drops signiﬁcantly. This is due to the increased and excessive evaporation of ethanol from
the reaction system, which shifts the equilibrium of the reaction towards the substrates.
Apparently, the optimum residence time at elevated temperatures should be kept in the
range of 3–4 h.
3.2. Optimization of Azeotropic Distillation
The azeotropic column (SCDS 5, Figure 1) is used to strip acetic acid from the reactor
vapors and for distillation of the EA–ET–W triple azeotrope. The reactor vapors are fed
to the last stage of the column, while the reﬂux (Stream 27, Figure 1)—a distillate washed
with water—is fed onto the ﬁrst stage. The obtained distillate is an azeotrope—with a
mass composition of 83.1% ethyl acetate, 8.7% ethanol, 8.2% water—which is directed to
the water extraction process. The bottom product from the column (Stream 7, Figure 1)
containing the stripped acetic acid is recycled to the reaction node.
Azeotropic distillation is limited by the amount of acetic acid in the distillate. The
product of appropriate quality should not contain more than 0.005 wt%. To assure the
required contents of AA in the distillate, both reﬂux ratio (R/V) and the number of stages
were adjusted. The results are shown in Figure 3.
Processes 2021, 9, 1425

Figure 3. The inﬂuence of R/V ratio and the number of stages on the acetic acid content in distillate
of the azeotropic column.
The acetic acid content strongly depends on the amount of the reﬂux applied to the
column. The required acidity (&lt;0.005 wt% of acetic acid) can be obtained with an R/V ratio
greater than 0.5 and with a minimum number of 14 theoretical stages.
3.3. Optimization of the Extraction System
The extraction node (EXTR 8, Figure 1) is found to be one of the most important
installation nodes with regard to the overall process performance. Analysis was focused
on the temperature of the azeotrope stream as well as the mass ratio of water:azeotrope
(W/A), both affecting the composition of the organic phase (richer in ethyl acetate) and
losses of the EA with wastewater. The results are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4.
The inﬂuence of temperature and water/azeotrope ratio on the EA content in the
organic phase.
It was observed that lowering the temperature has a positive effect on the content of
ethyl acetate in the organic phase. A temperature drop of every 10 ◦C increases the weight
fraction of ethyl acetate in the organic phase by about 0.15%. Lowering the temperature
from 50 ◦C to 20 ◦C increases the EA content by approximately 0.45%. This relatively small
change has a signiﬁcant impact on the amount of reﬂux recycled to the azeotropic column
as well as on the amount of azeotrope recycled from the product distillation column. It
Processes 2021, 9, 1425
8 of 16
is therefore proﬁtable to deeply cool down the azeotrope before extraction. Yet, due to
the fact that the process is limited by the cooling water temperature, the azeotrope can be
cooled down to 20–30 ◦C.
The content of ethyl acetate in the organic phase increases with an increased amount
of water during rinsing. However, by increasing the water ﬂowrate, the ethyl acetate
losses are bigger. The losses of EA also increase with the temperature. Furthermore,
the increased ﬂowrate of the rinsing water causes an excessive amount of wastewater to
be produced, and by this, the cost of raw material recovery by wastewater distillation
increases. Analyzing the modelling results, it can be concluded that the optimum mass
ratio of water to azeotrope is in the range between 1 and 2.
3.4. Optimization of Product Distillation
Organic-phase, enriched ethyl acetate is fed to the rectiﬁcation column (SCDS 11,
Figure 1). The puriﬁcation of ethyl acetate involves distilling off the triple azeotrope
consisting of water, ethanol and ethyl acetate. The distillate is recycled to the extraction
process. The bottom product is ethyl acetate with required purity greater than 99.9%.
First, the effect of the reﬂux ratio (R/D) on the composition of the bottom product as
well as reboiler duty were examined at a set, rigid product rate. The results are presented in
Figure 5. Next, at a set reﬂux ratio, the inﬂuence of the feed stage location and the number
of stages on the product quality as well as evaporator/reboiler heat duty were analyzed
(Figure 6).
Figure 5. The effect of R/D ratio on (a) the EA content in the product; (b) the water and ethanol content in the product;
(c) reboiler duty.

Figure 6. The impact of feed location and the number of stages on: (a) water content in the product; (b) EA content in the
product; (c) ethanol content in the product; (d) evaporator power.
The amount of reﬂux has an obvious key impact on the product quality. By increasing
the reﬂux, the purity of the product increases signiﬁcantly. The required EA content in the
product (99.9 wt%) can be obtained for minimum R/D equal to 1.5. The limit parameter
in this case is also the water content, which should be less than 0.03 wt% and an ethanol
content that should be less than 0.04 wt%. These parameters are met for R/D greater
than 2.25. The optimum R/D ratio is in the range 3–3.5. A higher reﬂux does provide an
insigniﬁcant increase in the product yield, while heat duties on both the evaporator and
the condenser increase proportionally.
The product quality is also inﬂuenced by both the EA feed location and the number of
column stages. As presented in Figure 6, the number of stages has a signiﬁcant impact on
the product purity. However, the feed location is also crucial. The best results were obtained
when the feed was located between the 6th and 4th column stage. The introduction to the
higher or lower stages of the column resulted in a deterioration of the product quality.
3.5. Optimization of Wastewater Distillation
From an ecological and economic point of view, the quality and the quantity of the
sewage produced is also of great interest. The aqueous phase after extraction contains a
large share of ethanol and ethyl acetate (over 15 wt%). Therefore, it is directed to a sewage
column, where the organics are separated from the water. Sewage processing is meant to
reduce the loss of raw materials, fresh water consumption and improve wastewater quality.
A mixture of ethyl acetate, ethanol and a small amount of water is collected as a
distillate in the column. This stream is recycled to the reactor. Water is obtained as the
bottom product, which is partly recycled to the extraction process. Only a small amount of
cleaned wastewater is released as sewage.
By modeling the wastewater distillation column (SCDS 15, Figure 1), the effect of reﬂux
ratio on the distillate composition and the bottom product, wastewater was examined. It
Processes 2021, 9, 1425
10 of 16
was assumed that the bottom product must contain less than 0.01% of its weight in organic
compounds. The inﬂuence of the reﬂux ratio on heat duty of the reboiler was also analyzed.
The results are shown in Figure 7a,b.
Figure 7. The inﬂuence of R/D ratio on: (a) the content of EA, water and ethanol in the distillate of the wastewater column;
(b) reboiler duty. The inﬂuence of column feeding place and the number of stages on: (c) water content in distillate;
(d) reboiler duty.
The distillate from the column is recycled to the reactor (Stream 21, Figure 1), so its
composition affects the reaction equilibrium. The more water we returned with the stream,
the more reﬂux we need on the azeotropic column. It is therefore important to keep the
water concentration as low as possible. Due to the fact that the three-component EA–ET–W
system creates the azeotrope with the lowest boiling point, we are not able to remove
water completely.
The amount of reﬂux is crucial to the composition of the distillate. By increasing the
amount of reﬂux, the content of EA and ethanol in the distillate increases, and the water
content decreases. With an increase in reﬂux (R/D) in the range from 0.1–1.5, you can see a
very large decrease in the water content in the distillate. With an R/D ratio greater than
1.5, no major changes can be seen.
The effect of the feed location and the number of stages on the composition of distillate
and the bottom product as well as reboiler heat duty were examined at a set reﬂux ratio 1.5
(Figure 7c,d).
The number of stages and the feed location affect the composition of the distillate and
the heat duty of the evaporator. Analyzing the graphs in Figure 7c,d, it was found that the
Processes 2021, 9, 1425

column must have reached at least seven stages in the stripping section and seven in the
reinforcing section.

4. Discussion
Based on the mass and heat balances of the installation, the consumption of raw
materials and energy for three different strategies were calculated. The results are shown
in Table 2.
The sensitivity study carried out by separate nodes as well as modelling of the three
listed complete process strategies led to the following observations. The inﬂuence of
subcooling the azeotrope (Stream 7, Figure 1) down to 30 ◦C results in an increased
requirement for cold by the condenser (HTXR 6, Figure 1). However, the advantage is a
higher contents of EA in the organic phase, after extraction (Stream 11, Figure 1), which is
the result of an enhanced removal of ethanol and water from azeotrope. The latter results
in a lower reﬂux requirement in the azeotropic column (SCDS 5, Figure 1), which then
leads to a lowered heat duty of the reactor evaporator.
The increased concentration of EA in the organic phase after extraction (Stream 11,
Figure 1) also results in a lowered heat duty by the product distillation column (SCDS 11,
Figure 1) as the amount of water and ethanol to be removed has been lowered.

Subcooling also lowers the contents of EA in the water phase, and as a consequence
lower heat duty by wastewater distillation (SCDS 15, Figure 1).
The lowered heat duty by these nodes results in a lower consumption of cooling water,
compensating with excess its higher requirement for stream eight subcooling by HTXR 6
(Figure 1). Thus the overall consumption of cooling energy is lower by kW/tproduct.
Thus shifting the phase equilibria by extraction leads to a process integration. The
product quality as well as the loss of EA with wastewater can be maintained without
stream 8 subcooling, only if the consumption of utilities is increased.
If the consumption of utilities was kept low—comparable to the proposed strategy,
then the product quality would be degraded from 99.9% down to 98.0% EA contents.
Consumption of fresh water would be increased from 1.42 to 2.18 t/tproduct. Due to this, a
wastewater amount would increase from 1.61 to 2.36 t/tproduct and the organic contents
would rise from 0.04% up to 0.21%. This would lead to an increased consumption of raw
ethanol, from 0.524 to 0.531 t/tproduct as it is excessively lost with wastewater.
5. Conclusions
The improved strategy (S1), based on shifting the extraction equilibria, leads to the
process integration which offers a signiﬁcant improvement of economic indicators when
compared to the classic approach (S2). Both the consumption of steam and cooling water
are reduced by over 10% each, while the requirements on either the product quality or
environmental protection are fulﬁlled. Comparing the enhanced strategy (S1) with the
classical approach, assuming the same energy consumption (S3):
•
ethanol consumption was reduced from 0.531 to 0.524 t/tproduct (−1.2%);
•
the amount of process water was reduced from 2.18 to 1.42 t/tproduct (−34.9%);
•
the product quality was improved from 98.0% to 99.9%;
•
wastewater production was reduced from 2.36 to 1.61 t/tproduct (−31.8%) and the
TOC/COD was reduced almost nine times.
