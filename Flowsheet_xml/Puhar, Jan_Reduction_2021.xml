Abstract: Production of formalin, which is among the highest production volume chemicals, is highly
energy-intensive; thus, reduction of energy use is very important in reducing cost and emissions. The
aim of this and its larger overall research is to systemically analyze how to improve sustainability
of processes producing formalin as an intermediate or ﬁnal product. In this part of the work,
energy consumption requirements are analyzed for the conventional formalin production process
via methane steam reforming, where opportunities for energy consumption reduction are identiﬁed.
This work will serve as a base case for further investigation of alternative formalin production
pathways. To achieve energy savings, heat integration technology by combined pinch analysis and
mathematical programming is applied. The formalin production process is simulated using Aspen
HYSYS, and heat integration of the production process was performed based on simulated design
using GAMS software. Economic and environmental footprint analyses were performed for both
non-integrated and integrated designs. Results show that heat integration reduces heat consumption
by around 39%, leading to a saving of 11% in capital cost and turning annual operating cost into
positive revenue. Heat integration also improves the environmental aspect, where a 7–22% reduction
in selected environmental footprints is achieved.
Keywords: formalin production process; energy consumption reduction; heat integration; pinch
analysis; mathematical programming; economic performance; environmental footprint analysis
1. Introduction
Modern chemical industries and supply chains currently face numerous challenges
that threaten their continued success in an increasingly complex environment. The pressure
on modern companies to go clean and sustainable to compete in an ever-changing economy
is enormous. Circularity of production systems is important for sustainability and sustain-
able systems to obtain minimal resource use and maximal reuse of energy and materials.
Cyclic production systems are the goal of industrial ecology and the circular economy. The
issue is being tackled on many fronts, from increasing the energy consumption of present
technologies, to redesigning and challenging the conventional approaches on multiple
levels along the supply chains [1].
Modern complex systems that require a holistic approach rather than a linear one are
best viewed through the lens of systems thinking, which enables a better understanding
of the system and offers more effective solutions [2]. As a group of interconnected parts
(process units and ﬂows) that together form a whole, every single chemical industrial
process represents a system. The same is true for a factory with an organizational hierarchy
and speciﬁed goals. In systemic structures, decisions are often derived from these complex
hierarchies and can be better managed with systems thinking tools [3]. Various newly
developed technologies and techniques are expected to improve the currently unsustainable
state of industrial systems [4]. It is vital to adopt more sustainable technologies in supply

chains [5], to interconnect different industrial processes, and directly use secondary raw
materials, byproducts and waste as inputs, especially in the production of bulk chemicals.
One of these bulk chemicals is formalin, which is a 37% aqueous solution of formalde-
hyde and ranks in the top 50 chemicals produced worldwide [6]. It is a key platform
chemical and an important precursor for a variety of products and value-added chemicals,
such as the production of resins, disinfectants, adhesives, coatings and many other products
for various industries [7], while it also offers potential applications in the future energy
sector [8]. Most of the formalin is currently produced by methanol oxidation [8], while
methanol is typically produced from natural gas producing syngas, converting syngas to
crude methanol and purifying methanol [9]. Most of the methanol, which is highly-energy
intensive [10], is used in the production of formaldehyde [9]. Contrary to current practice,
methanol and formalin production processes could be operated sustainably regarding
materials and energy [11].
In this work, the main goal is to obtain a formalin production process with minimum
energy requirements. A formalin production process was ﬁrst simulated; heat integration
(HI) was then applied to reduce utility consumption by a combination of pinch analysis
(PA) and mathematical programming (MP) [12], where a sequential three-step approach
was used. The ﬁrst two steps were optimization steps to achieve minimum utility cost with
the least number of heat exchange units. Based on these two steps, the heat exchanger
network (HEN) of the process was designed. The economic and environmental impacts of
implementing HI within the process were further evaluated. Both capital and operating cost
were calculated, while environmental footprints were calculated based on life cycle analysis
(LCA). By applying process systems engineering (PSE) techniques, a more sustainable
formalin production process was designed.
Few studies have dealt with the applications of PSE to the formalin production process.
Kovaˇc Kralj [13] used the PA method to perform total site HI between production processes
of solvent, methanol and formalin. However, in this study, capital cost and environmental
impacts were not assessed. Qi and Li [14] used the PA method to analyze an existing
HEN for a simulated methanol-to-formaldehyde production process, where savings in hot
and cold utility consumption were achieved. Studies also analyzed how HI affects utility
consumption and subsequently the economic and environmental impacts of methanol
production process. Kijevˇcanin et al. [15] used PA to reduce utility consumption and
achieve a viable trade-off between capital and utility cost. Chen et al. [16] developed a
simultaneous HI approach based on linear programming formulations and applied it to
a methanol production process. Maréchal et al. [17] modiﬁed the methanol process by
applying simulation models and a new synthesis strategy. Improvements in overall energy
balance and conversion were achieved; however HEN was not designed in detail.
Several investigations have also been undertaken on the economic and environmen-
tal analysis of various systems, such as diffusion of electric vehicles [18], wastewater
management [19], bioenergy systems [20], biogas supply networks [21], company supply
networks [22] and many others. Based on the literature review, it was found that no studies
had dealt with systematic analysis of cost, energy and emissions of the formalin production
process, even though formaldehyde is among the top chemicals produced in the United
States by quantity [23] and is among the basic organic chemicals. Analysis had not been
performed for either the classical process via methane steam reforming (MSR) or for the
more sustainable process, such as formalin produced by captured CO2 and renewable
hydrogen, produced by biomass gasiﬁcation and the like.
In this work a comprehensive technical, economic and environmental footprint analy-
sis of the formalin production process via MSR is performed. The process is ﬁrst simulated
using Aspen HYSYS software, where energy consumption requirements are analyzed.
Moreover, HI was applied to improve energy efﬁciency and to enhance energy savings
in formalin industries. Additionally, economic evaluation and environmental footprint
analysis were carried out for both non-integrated and heat-integrated processes. The
conclusions of this work will serve as a basis for technical, economic and environmental

assessment of more sustainable formaldehyde production and production processes that
use formaldehyde as a raw material.
2. Methodology
Reduction of energy consumption, and consequently the cost of and emissions from
the formalin production process by the most common method MSR are analyzed by a
sequential HI approach. In this section, a general description of the formalin production
process via MSR is ﬁrst presented. The methodology for HI, and economic and envi-
ronmental footprint analysis are then described. Energy use, operating and capital cost
and environmental footprints were evaluated for both the non-integrated (simulated) and
heat-integrated process.
Simulation of MSR to methanol and further to formalin was carried out using Aspen
HYSYS software [24]. Based on the simulation, a sequential three-step approach was used
to obtain HEN design and a proposed heat-integrated process ﬂowsheet by combined
PA/MP.
Economic evaluation was carried out by calculating operating cost and capital cost
based on the factors method [25]. Environmental footprint analysis was performed using
OpenLCA software [26], where various environmental footprints (greenhouse gas (GHG),
nitrogen, phosphorus, ecological and energy footprints) and human toxicity potential
were evaluated. A ﬂowchart showing the framework of applied methodology is shown in
Figure 1.

2.1. Formalin Production via Methane Steam Reforming 
Formalin is a 37 wt % aqueous solution of formaldehyde and is the most common 
formaldehyde product [27]. Most formaldehyde is produced by subsequent processes of 
methane steam reforming (MSR), synthesis of methanol and synthesis of formaldehyde 
from methanol and air. Figure 2 shows a simplified block diagram of the formalin pro-
duction process via MSR. The flowsheet is composed of three different production parts: 
i) MSR, ii) methanol synthesis and iii) formalin synthesis. Formalin is obtained as the de-
sired product, along with an aqueous mixture of methanol as a byproduct.

ers. The reactions occurring during the MSR process are shown in Equations (1) and (2). 
Equation (1) stands for methane reforming, which is an endothermic reaction, where CH4 
reacts with high-temperature steam under pressure to syngas, consisting of CO and H2.

2.2. Energy Consumption Reduction 
Heat integration (HI) was performed in three steps: i) minimizing utility cost; ii) min-
imizing the number of heat exchange units and iii) heat exchanger network (HEN) design. 
The general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) [29] was used for minimizing utility cost 
and for minimizing the number of heat exchange units. 
Stream data was first extracted from Aspen HYSYS simulation. Then, in the first step 
of HI, utility cost was minimized with a linear programming (LP) model by using an ex-
panded transshipment model [30]. The objective function for the model is shown in Equa-

In the second step, the number of heat exchange units was minimized. The transship-
ment model was expanded to include binary variables representing connections between 
the hot and cold streams. This was solved using a mixed-integer linear programming 
(MILP) model, which is called the MILP expanded transshipment model [30]. Heat duty 
values for specific utilities as obtained from the first step were fixed in the model. A set of

MSR is one of the most common processes for syngas production, from which a variety
of bulk chemicals are produced, like hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and many others. The
reactions occurring during the MSR process are shown in Equations (1) and (2). Equation (1)
stands for methane reforming, which is an endothermic reaction, where CH4 reacts with
high-temperature steam under pressure to syngas, consisting of CO and H2. Equation (2)
represents the water gas shift (WGS) reaction to enhance H2 production efﬁciency.

Moreover, methanol is produced from syngas, based on equilibrium reactions of
oxocarbons and hydrogen:

In the last part of the process, formalin is produced from methanol and air, where the
overall process is a combination of partial oxidation and dehydrogenation reactions [28]:
2CH3OH + 0.5O2 → 2CH2O + H2O + H2, ∆H0
r = −36kJ/mol

2.2. Energy Consumption Reduction
Heat integration (HI) was performed in three steps: (i) minimizing utility cost; (ii)
minimizing the number of heat exchange units and (iii) heat exchanger network (HEN)
design. The general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) [29] was used for minimizing
utility cost and for minimizing the number of heat exchange units.
Stream data was ﬁrst extracted from Aspen HYSYS simulation. Then, in the ﬁrst
step of HI, utility cost was minimized with a linear programming (LP) model by using
an expanded transshipment model [30]. The objective function for the model is shown in
Equation (7):
min∑
HU ∑
CU
(cHU·QHU + cCU·QCU)
(7)
where QHU and QCU are the consumption of hot and cold utilities, and cHU and cCU are
the cost coefﬁcients of hot and cold utilities.
In the second step, the number of heat exchange units was minimized. The transship-
ment model was expanded to include binary variables representing connections between
the hot and cold streams. This was solved using a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) model, which is called the MILP expanded transshipment model [30]. Heat duty
values for speciﬁc utilities as obtained from the ﬁrst step were ﬁxed in the model. A set
of binary variables yi,j and a set of equations connecting the variables to the streams were
Systems 2021, 9, 5
5 of 17
added to the model. The objective in the second step was to minimize the sum of binary
variables, as shown in Equation (8):
min∑
i ∑
j
(yi,j)
(8)
where yi,j are the available connections between hot and cold streams exchanging heat.
The minimum number of heat exchange units and a table displaying the amount of heat
exchanged between streams were obtained as results. GAMS was also used for the second
step.
In the third step, HEN was obtained based on the results from the second step and
heuristics, and a ﬂowsheet of the production process based on HI was proposed. A
minimum temperature approach (∆Tmin) and the cp inequality rule [25] were considered
for each individual match for designing HEN. For HEN design, parallel arrangement was
prioritized over a series arrangement [31]. Finally, the heat exchangers were arranged
in such a way as to minimize the total heat exchanger area. The heat exchanger area
calculation is shown in Equation (9):
A =
Q
U·∆Tln
(9)
where Q is the heat transferred between streams, U is the heat transfer coefﬁcient and ∆Tln
is the logarithmic mean temperature difference. As a result of the HEN design, total utility
consumption, exchanged heat and total heat exchanger area were obtained.
2.3. Economic and Environmental Footprint Analysis
For economic evaluation, both capital and operating costs were calculated. For capital
cost estimation, the factors method [32] was used. The base factor for capital cost is the
delivered (purchased) cost of process equipment, calculated for each piece of equipment
depending on its material and size. Equipment cost is further adjusted for inﬂation
using the chemical engineering plant cost index (CEPCI) [32]. Operating costs were
calculated on a yearly basis and comprise costs for the following: raw materials, utilities,
labor, maintenance, quality assurance and depreciation cost, which depend on the total
depreciable capital investment.
Environmental footprint analysis was performed using the cradle-to-gate approach
and was based on the production of 1 kg of formalin. Selected environmental footprints
were evaluated using OpenLCA software [26], such as GHG, nitrogen, phosphorus, ecolog-
ical and energy footprints and human toxicity potential.
3. Description of the Formalin Production Process and Heat Integration Approach
In this section, the formalin production process is described in detail. The sequential
HEN design method approach for HI is then presented, including extracted data for the
HEN design.
3.1. Process Description
The formalin production process is presented in Figure 3, where physical properties
for all mixtures in the MSR part and in the methanol synthesis loop were estimated using
Peng–Robinson equations of state. MSR is a catalytic process, which occurs in three phases:
methane steam reforming, WGS and water removal. Methane reforming takes place in the
reactor R1 over the Ni/α-Al2O catalyst [33], where the inlet ﬂow of methane is 53.5 m3/h
and steam 35.5 m3/h. The inlet ﬂows were ﬁrst heated to the reforming conditions. The
outﬂow temperature after reactor R1 was 850 ◦C, which was cooled to 200 ◦C (hot stream
H1) and introduced into the equilibrium reactor R2, where the low-temperature WGS
reaction takes place (Equation (2)). The stream was further cooled to 40 ◦C (hot stream
H2). Water was then eliminated in separator S1 prior to introduction to compressors. A
Systems 2021, 9, 5

multistage compression train was implemented with interstage coolers to 40 ◦C, where a
maximum compression factor of 5 was observed throughout the simulation. Condensate
water collected from separators S1 and S2 was pressurized via pumps P1 and P2 to the
same pressure downstream of compressor C3 (considering the pressure drop in H5). In this
way, it is possible to introduce the syngas stream combined with water to the R3 reactor.

stream H2). Water was then eliminated in separator S1 prior to introduction to compres-
sors. A multistage compression train was implemented with interstage coolers to 40 °C, 
where a maximum compression factor of 5 was observed throughout the simulation. Con-
densate water collected from separators S1 and S2 was pressurized via pumps P1 and P2 
to the same pressure downstream of compressor C3 (considering the pressure drop in 
H5). In this way, it is possible to introduce the syngas stream combined with water to the 
R3 reactor. 
 
Figure 3. Formalin production process. 
Methanol synthesis was simulated using a Gibbs reactor R3, where reactions occur 
as specified in Equations (3)–(5). A Gibbs reactor is a HYSYS built-in module, which min-
imizes Gibbs free energy for the reaction products at equilibrium [24]. The R3 reactor out-
flow was later expanded with expander E1 to 10 bar and introduced to separator S3, where 
non-condensable (H2, CO2 and CH4) were separated from the methanol-water flow. 
Stream 27 represents recycling of 60% non-condensable back to the methane inflow, and 
stream 28 the purge gas outflow, which contained about 78.7% CH4, 18.1% H2 and small 
amounts of CO2 and methanol. This stream was further compressed, cooled and separated 
in S4 prior to burning in a furnace. 
For the formalin synthesis, the NRTL property package was used to predict liquid 
phase activity coefficients. The methanol-water stream and air inlet stream (75 m3/h) were 
preheated to 150 °C and introduced to the R4 conversion reactor, where formaldehyde 
was synthesized. A conversion of 87.4% was achieved using a silver catalyst [34]. The out-
let stream was cooled to 50 °C and introduced into the S5 separator, where separation of 
the formaldehyde-water stream and other gases (H2, N2, O2 with some H2O, CH3OH and 
CH2O) occurred. Stream 44 was then introduced to distillation column DC, from which 
37.5% formalin and an aqueous mixture of CH3OH were obtained. Gases emerging from 
separator S5 were cooled further to 50 °C and separated again in separator S6, to separate 
the residual of CH2O, CH3OH and H2O, which was recycled. The process was scaled to 
produce about 1075 t of formalin per day.

Methanol synthesis was simulated using a Gibbs reactor R3, where reactions occur
as speciﬁed in Equations (3)–(5). A Gibbs reactor is a HYSYS built-in module, which
minimizes Gibbs free energy for the reaction products at equilibrium [24]. The R3 reactor
outﬂow was later expanded with expander E1 to 10 bar and introduced to separator S3,
where non-condensable (H2, CO2 and CH4) were separated from the methanol-water ﬂow.
Stream 27 represents recycling of 60% non-condensable back to the methane inﬂow, and
stream 28 the purge gas outﬂow, which contained about 78.7% CH4, 18.1% H2 and small
amounts of CO2 and methanol. This stream was further compressed, cooled and separated
in S4 prior to burning in a furnace.

3.2. Heat Integration of the Formalin Process
The process of formalin production was highly energy intensive. Table 1 shows utility
consumption in the formalin production process obtained from the simulation in Aspen
HYSYS (schematic representation is shown in Figure 3). For heating, ﬁred heat (FH) with
temperatures between 1000 and 150 ◦C was used, while for cooling, air was used. MP

steam was also generated in the process, with temperatures between 25 and 200 ◦C. The
consumption of hot utility (FH) was 151.7 MW, with a heat transfer area of 27,824 m2.
The consumption of cold utility (air) was 9.8 MW, with a heat exchange area of 2616 m2.
Additionally, 141.4 MW of medium pressure steam (MPS) was generated, as shown in
Table 1. The total energy consumption of the process before HI was 302.9 MW and the heat
exchanger area was 45,045 m2.

Figure 4 shows the grand composite curve (GCC) of the process. The pinch tempera-
ture was at 600/610 ◦C. Minimum energy requirements for heating were 42.02 MW and
68.25 MW for cooling. However, in the study it was considered that the heat from the
reactions in R1 and R4, which were not process streams, and heat for distillation (reboiler
and condenser), where temperature control is difﬁcult [25], were not available for HI.
Consequently, the utility consumption obtained was higher than the target.
The extracted data in the problem table and utility data were entered into the expanded
transshipment model in GAMS [30] to minimize the cost/maximize proﬁt. In the second
step, the number of heat exchange units was minimized by a MILP expanded transshipment
model [30], also in GAMS. In the third step, the heat exchangers were arranged using
heuristics and the results from the second step, as described in Section 2.2. The HI results
and the proposed heat-integrated production process based on HI are shown in Section 5.

4. Economic Performance and Footprint Analysis 
In this section, evaluation of the economic performance, environmental footprints 
and human toxicity potential was described. The calculation procedure for obtaining cap-
ital investment cost and total annual cost is shown. For footprint and human toxicity po-
tential assessment, a description was provided, including life cycle inventory (LCI) for the 
process before and after HI. 
4.1. Economic Performance 
To evaluate economic performance, capital cost, which consists of direct and indirect 
cost, was first estimated using the factors method [32]. Equipment delivered (purchased) 
cost was first calculated for each process unit, based on the equations factoring in variables 
for size and material. The following variables were considered: power required for com-
pressors and expanders, diameter, height and number of trays for distillation columns, 
heat exchange area for heat exchangers, volume flow and electric motor power required 
for pumps and height and diameter for vessels (reactors and separators). For mixers and 
splitters, cost was considered negligible. The equations used in this section are based on 
the literature [32]. Total equipment delivered cost was converted to EUR and adjusted to 
2019 value [35] using the CEPCI index [36]. 
Direct cost was calculated using factors for installation, which include the costs for 
equipment erection, piping, instrumentation, electrical installation, insulation, buildings, 
site preparation and off-sites. Direct cost (CD) was calculated using Equation (10), where 
installation factors were accumulated:

4. Economic Performance and Footprint Analysis
In this section, evaluation of the economic performance, environmental footprints and
human toxicity potential was described. The calculation procedure for obtaining capital
investment cost and total annual cost is shown. For footprint and human toxicity potential
assessment, a description was provided, including life cycle inventory (LCI) for the process
before and after HI.
4.1. Economic Performance
To evaluate economic performance, capital cost, which consists of direct and indirect
cost, was ﬁrst estimated using the factors method [32]. Equipment delivered (purchased)
cost was ﬁrst calculated for each process unit, based on the equations factoring in variables
for size and material. The following variables were considered: power required for com-
pressors and expanders, diameter, height and number of trays for distillation columns,
heat exchange area for heat exchangers, volume ﬂow and electric motor power required
for pumps and height and diameter for vessels (reactors and separators). For mixers and
splitters, cost was considered negligible. The equations used in this section are based on
the literature [32]. Total equipment delivered cost was converted to EUR and adjusted to
2019 value [35] using the CEPCI index [36].
Direct cost was calculated using factors for installation, which include the costs for
equipment erection, piping, instrumentation, electrical installation, insulation, buildings,
site preparation and off-sites. Direct cost (CD) was calculated using Equation (10), where
installation factors were accumulated:
CD = 2.62·CE
(10)
where CE is equipment cost.
Indirect cost (CI) includes the cost of engineering and construction and was calculated
using Equation (11):
CI = 1.00·CE
(11)
The cost for contractors and contingencies (CCC) was next calculated using Equation (12):
CCC = 0.15·(CD + CI)
(12)
The capital cost (CCAP) was calculated using Equation (13):
CCAP = CCC + CD + CI
(13)
Systems 2021, 9, 5
9 of 17
Working capital and start-up cost (CWC) was calculated using Equation (14):
CWC = 0.05·CCAP
(14)
Finally, total capital investment (CINV) was calculated using Equation (15):
CINV = CWC+CCAP
(15)
Total annual cost was then estimated, factoring in the cost of raw materials, utilities,
labor, maintenance, quality assurance and depreciation cost. The depreciation cost (CDEP)
depends on the total depreciable capital and was calculated using Equation (16):
CDEP = CCAP
N
(16)
where N is the plant lifespan, which was assumed to be 25 years.
The maintenance cost (CMAIN) also depends on the capital cost and was calculated:
CMAIN = 0.06·CCAP
(17)
The annual costs of tax and insurance and miscellaneous costs were labeled as other
costs (COTHER), and were calculated using Equation (18):
COTHER = 0.08·CCAP
(18)
The labor cost (CL) was estimated to depend on the hourly wage and number of
employees. The quality assurance cost (CQA) was assumed to be 15% of the labor cost. The
utility (CUTIL) and raw material costs (CRM) were based on consumption and market prices.
Finally, the total annual cost (CTAC) was calculated using Equation (19):
CTAC = CDEP + CMAIN + COTHER + CL + CQA + CUTIL + CRM
(19)
4.2. Footprint Analysis
Environmental impact assessment was performed based on the production of 1 kg
of formalin before and after HI. Different footprints were evaluated in close relation to
worldwide concerns over threats to human society. The ﬁve most important footprints
from the “Footprint Family” [37] and high-risk planetary boundaries [38] were considered,
such as GHG, nitrogen, phosphorus, ecological and energy footprint and human toxicity
potential [39].
The GHG footprint reﬂects total GHG emissions over the life cycle of a product,
expressed as kg of CO2 equivalent [39]. It was calculated using the IPCC 2013 GWP
methodology over a 100-y time horizon. The nitrogen footprint measures all the nitrogen
compounds except N2 released into the environment over the life cycle of a product and
is expressed in mass units of N [39]. The phosphorus footprint reﬂects the phosphorus
imbalance [39] that occurs because of the increasing phosphorus consumption by humans
and livestock [40] and is expressed in mass units of P. The ecological footprint measures the
biologically productive land and sea area required to supply resources over the life cycle of
a product [39]. It is measured in units of biologically productive global land area (in m2·y).
The energy footprint represents the consumption of non-renewable or renewable energy
sources across the product life cycle [41]. Human toxicity potential reﬂects the effects of
toxic substances on human health. It enables relative comparisons between a large number
of chemicals that may contribute to cancer or other negative human effects for an inﬁnite
time horizon [42]. It is expressed as 1,4-dichlorobenzene equivalents.
To evaluate the environmental footprints and human toxicity potential of the formalin
process, OpenLCA 1.10.3 software [26], the Ecoinvent 3.6 database [43] and the data
obtained from the simulations in Aspen HYSYS were used. The LCA study was performed
applying a cradle-to-gate variant, which is a partial LCA utilizing a systemic approach to
Systems 2021, 9, 5

calculate environmental impacts associated with a product, taking into account all relevant
inputs and outputs of a product system during its lifetime. As LCA studies consider
entire supply chains of materials and utilities, there is potential to signiﬁcantly reduce
environmental impacts and increase sustainability.
Table 3 summarizes the main life cycle inventory (LCI) data for the formalin production
process before and after HI. LCI includes the main inputs of raw materials and utilities, and
the main outputs (products and emissions) and is shown for 1 kg of formalin production.

5. Results and Discussion
Sequential three-step HI was performed for the energy-intensive formalin production
process to reduce energy use, cost and emissions.
In the ﬁrst step, an expanded transshipment model was used to obtain a minimum
utility consumption of 183.0 MW, of which 91.8 MW was for heating and 91.2 MW for
cooling (targets are 42.0 and 68.3 MW, as shown from GCC in Figure 4). Fired heat was
assumed to be used for heating, and MP steam and air for cooling. MP steam was also
generated to cool the ﬁred heater fuel to 150 ◦C. In this way, 37.7 MW of MP steam was
generated, as shown in Table 4. By performing HI, hot utility consumption was reduced
from 151.7 to 91.8 MW, while cold utility consumption was reduced from 151.2 to 91.3 MW
(see also Table 1), representing a 39.5% reduction in hot and 39.6% reduction in cold
utility consumption.
In the second step, the values for utility consumption were ﬁxed as obtained from
the ﬁrst step. The MILP expanded transshipment model was used to obtain the minimum
number of heat exchange units, which was 17. A table displaying the amount of heat
exchanged between the streams was also obtained.
In the third step, HEN was obtained using the data from the second step and heuristics.
Heat exchange matches were arranged according to ∆Tmin of 10 ◦C and the cp inequality
rule, as described in Section 2.2. Table 4 shows heat exchange matches, where each column
represents one heat exchange match. Cumulative utility consumption, total exchanged
heat, and total heat exchange area are also presented in Table 4, where utility consumption
amounts to 183.1 MW, and 59.9 MW of heat was exchanged. A similar value was obtained
in the ﬁrst step of the sequential HEN design method. The slight difference in the value
was attributed to changing certain matches due to constraints. The calculated total heat
exchange area of the HEN was 43,522.2 m2, reduced from 45,045 m2 before HI. The total
number of heat exchangers in the HEN was 17, as also obtained in the second step where
it was minimized. Therefore, this number of heat exchangers represents the minimum
number of units.

The data from Table 4 was used for a schematic design of HEN, which is shown
in Figure 5. After HI, nine coolers (marked in blue), three heaters (marked in red), ﬁve
process-to-process heat exchangers (indicated with grey) and one utility-to-utility heat
exchanger (indicated with green) were suggested. Cold process streams C1, C2, C3 and C4
were heated completely by exchanging heat with the hot streams and did not require hot
utilities. Heat exchangers 13 and 14 together accounted for 76.6% of the heat duty reduction
(45.9 MW out of 59.9 MW, see also Table 4). As described in the Methodology section, the
utility streams for air and MP steam generation were split for the heat exchangers to be
connected in parallel. Heat exchangers utilizing ﬁred heat were connected in series, which
was done because of temperature difference constraints.
Figure 6 shows the proposed heat integrated formalin production process. The pro-
posed formalin production process ﬂowsheet was obtained by combining the ﬂowsheet
before HI (Figure 3) with the HEN shown in the grid diagram in Figure 5. The numbered
heat exchange units in Table 4, and in the grid diagram in Figure 5 matched those in the
proposed formalin production process ﬂowsheet in Figure 6.
Cost analysis was performed before and after HI. A notable reduction in equipment
cost was achieved, from 32.3 × 106 EUR before HI, to 28.8 × 106 EUR after HI. Part of
the reduced cost was due to reduced heat exchange area, and to some ﬁred heater units
being replaced by less costly shell-and-tube heat exchangers. The heat exchange area was
reduced from 45,045 to 43,522 m2 (by 3.4%). In total, the purchased cost of all heat exchange
units was reduced by 29.5% after HI. These reduced equipment costs had a direct effect on
other investment costs, as described in the Methodology section. Purchased equipment
cost was reduced by 10.9%, and subsequently, total capital investment was reduced from
141.3 × 106 EUR to 125.8 × 106 EUR (also by 10.9%). All cost reductions are shown in
Table 5.

Operating cost also decreased after HI. The most signiﬁcant decrease was achieved in
the utility cost, where revenue was obtained rather than decreased cost. This was attributed
to the signiﬁcant amounts of MP steam being generated. Steam was generated and sold in
both integrated and non-integrated designs, and owing to the decrease in heating costs
of ﬁred heat after HI, these revenues increased from 8.8 × 106 to 29.4 × 106 EUR. The
revenues were large enough to offset other cost such as depreciation and maintenance cost,
and as a result, total annual costs were turned from a loss to a proﬁt after HI. Changes in
utility revenue and total annual cost can also be seen in Table 5.
The pie charts shown in Figure 7 indicate the contributions of various categories to
the total annual cost of the process before and after HI, including utility revenues. The
increase in utility revenues is shown as the most notable change, where the increase after
HI caused utility revenues to exceed the total annual cost.

Among annual costs, other costs form the largest contribution (32%). They were fol-
lowed by depreciation cost (23%) and maintenance cost (21%), while labor and raw mate-
rial cost contributed only a small percentage of the annual cost (around 1%). After HI, 
equipment and capital costs were reduced, and thus a notable reduction in these catego-
ries was obtained (see Figure 7, right, vs. Figure 7, left). 
Total annual costs represented in the pie charts amount to 30.1 × 106 EUR/y before HI 
(Figure 7, left) and 26.9 × 106 EUR/y after HI (Figure 7, right). If utility revenues were not 
considered, other costs amounted to 41% of total annual costs, and the remaining costs 
largely comprised depreciation and maintenance costs. The distribution of these catego-
ries remained the same before and after HI. 
Environmental evaluation of the process was finally performed before and after HI. 
The data for footprint and human toxicity potential analysis are as shown in Table 3. The 
footprint and human toxicity potential values per kg of formalin before and after HI are 
shown in Figure 8. After HI, all six evaluated environmental categories were reduced. 
Reductions in the evaluated environmental footprints are shown in Table 6, where the 
highest reduction percentage was obtained for GHG and ecological footprints.

puts of fired heat and boiler feed water used to generate steam. The footprint values for 
electricity (used for compressors, pumps and air coolers) and natural gas remained the 
same before and after HI. Electricity contributed the most to the energy footprint, while 
natural gas contributes the most to human toxicity potential. The column labeled “Other*” 
reflected the contribution of gaseous outputs to the GHG footprint during the production 
process.

6. Conclusions 
The formalin production process was first simulated and included three production 
parts, MSR, methanol synthesis and formaldehyde synthesis. Based on the simulated de-
sign, HI using PA/MP was performed. With 53 m3/h of methane, 35 m3/h of steam and 75 
m3/h of air as raw materials, 39.5 t/h of 37.5% formalin and 2.4 t/h of aqueous methanol 
mixture were obtained. 
The process, as shown in Figure 3, consumed 151.7 MW of hot utilities and 151.2 MW 
of cold utilities. After performing HI, consumption of both hot and cold utilities was re-
duced by 59.9 MW (by about 39.5%), and total utility consumption was reduced by 119.9

6. Conclusions
The formalin production process was ﬁrst simulated and included three production
parts, MSR, methanol synthesis and formaldehyde synthesis. Based on the simulated
design, HI using PA/MP was performed. With 53 m3/h of methane, 35 m3/h of steam
and 75 m3/h of air as raw materials, 39.5 t/h of 37.5% formalin and 2.4 t/h of aqueous
methanol mixture were obtained.
The process, as shown in Figure 3, consumed 151.7 MW of hot utilities and 151.2 MW of
cold utilities. After performing HI, consumption of both hot and cold utilities was reduced
by 59.9 MW (by about 39.5%), and total utility consumption was reduced by 119.9 MW.
The total heat exchange area was also reduced, from 45,045 to 43,522 m2 (by 1523 m2 or
3.4%). The total number of heat exchangers was 17 in both the non heat-integrated and
heat-integrated designs.
Economic analysis of the process before and after HI showed that total capital invest-
ment cost was reduced by 15.4 × 106 EUR or 10.9%. With reduced utility consumption
after HI, utility revenues increased by 20.7 × 106 EUR/y, turning a total annual cost into
positive revenue.
Analysis of environmental footprints showed that selected footprint categories were
reduced by 7–22% owing to reduced utility consumption. All the analyzed environmental
categories showed that reductions in consumption of a boiler feed water and ﬁred heat
contributed the most to reducing environmental burden.
In future work, different, more sustainable formalin production routes, sourced from
renewables and waste (such as from biomass or waste CO2 from larger point sources) will
be synthesized and compared to the conventional process of MSR. Additionally, for each
technology, sustainability evaluation (economic, environmental and social assessment) will
be performed. As in the case of formalin, simulations will be performed for urea production
from renewable and waste sources and technical, economic and environmental evaluation
will be carried out. The ﬁnal aim was to synthesize and comprehensively evaluate different
routes for more sustainable melamine etheriﬁed resin (MER) ﬁber production.
