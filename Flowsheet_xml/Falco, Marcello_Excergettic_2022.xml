Abstract: Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) is a viable solution to valorise the CO2 captured
from industrial plants’ ﬂue gas, thus avoiding emitting it and synthesizing products with high added
value. On the other hand, using CO2 as a reactant in chemical processes is a challenging task, and a
rigorous analysis of the performance is needed to evaluate the real impact of CCU technologies in
terms of efﬁciency and environmental footprint. In this paper, the energetic performance of a DME
and methanol synthesis process fed by 25% of the CO2 captured from a natural gas combined cycle
(NGCC) power plant and by the green hydrogen produced through an electrolyser was evaluated.
The remaining 75% of the CO2 was compressed and stored underground. The process was assessed
by means of an exergetic analysis and compared to post-combustion Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS), where 100% of the CO2 captured was stored underground. Through the exergy analysis, the
quality degradation of energy was quantiﬁed, and the sources of irreversibility were detected. The
carbon-emitting source was a 189 MW Brayton–Joule power plant, which was mainly responsible
for exergy destruction. The CCU conﬁguration showed a higher exergy efﬁciency than the CCS,
but higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon dioxide. In the DME/methanol production
plant, the main contribution to exergy destruction was given by the distillation column separating
the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the component
with the highest irreversibility (45% of the total). Additionally, the methanol/DME synthesis reactor
destroyed a signiﬁcant amount of exergy (24%). Globally, DME/methanol synthesis from CO2 and
green hydrogen is feasible from an exergetic point of view, with 2.276 MJ of energy gained per 1 MJ
of exergy destroyed.
Keywords: carbon capture and utilization; methanol and DME production; exergy analysis
1. Introduction
Climate change mitigation is a worldwide effort that involves all countries around the
world. Among all problems, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have a signiﬁcant impact on
the environment. Regarding this matter, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the United Nations Climate Change Conference have established the needs of
reducing CO2 emissions (recognized as the gas mainly responsible for climate change) and
mitigating the global average temperature increase. Targets were set up, proposals to reach
them were provided, and some technologies were identiﬁed as a solution in counteracting
this issue.

The extensive concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a threat to environ-
mental safety, contributing to the greenhouse effect, but CO2 is a source of carbon for plants
and can also be used as a reactant in chemical reactions [1–3]. This concept has led to the
development of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies, which are perceived
as a more justiﬁed and socially acceptable technology for CO2 management than Carbon
Capture and Storage (CCS). However, even if they can be considered a feasible solution,
their cost is still an issue. Hasan et al. proposed a national Carbon Capture Utilization and
Storage (CCUS) supply chain network for a U.S. case study in their multiscale framework
analysis [4]. With the proposed solution focused on proﬁt rather than maximizing CO2 uti-
lization, average proﬁts between $0.3 and $17.6 per ton of CO2 were achieved (depending
on the weighted average total costs of capturing and utilizing a ton of CO2).
There are plenty of ways to apply CCU technology wherever there is a CO2-emitting
source, e.g., energy-intensive industry branches, such as energy, petrochemical and cement
or iron and steel production. Additionally, CCU reactions can be supported with green
technologies, such as renewable energy sources (RES).
The ﬁrst step in a CCU process is the capturing of CO2 through well-known technolo-
gies, such as oxyfuel combustion, pre-combustion or post-combustion, or as a direct-air
capture process [5,6]. Post-combustion carbon capture can be achieved by physical or
chemical separation methods, such as membranes, adsorption, absorption and cryogenic
processes. Many of these technologies are already applied in industry [7]. Pre-combustion
processes capture CO2 prior to the combustion reaction and it can be achieved with the
coal gasiﬁcation process or with oil or gas fuel-reforming processes [8].
After having captured and concentrated the CO2, it can be fed to a chemical reactor for
its conversion into products, such as syngas, urea, methane, ethanol, formic acid, etc. This
paper is focused on the analysis of conﬁgurations to synthesize methanol and dimethyl
ether (DME) from CO2.
Dimethyl ether (DME) or methoxymethane is the simplest aliphatic ether with the
molecular formula CH3OCH3. It is a colourless, near-odourless gas under ambient con-
ditions. It is neither a toxic nor carcinogenic compound, with properties similar to liquid
petroleum gas (LPG); thus, it can be easily blended with it and used as a fuel [9–11]. In
the chemical industry, it is mainly used to produce diethyl sulphate, methyl acetate, light
oleﬁns and gasoline [12]. Nowadays, it is considered an alternative fuel with low emis-
sions of NOx, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide [2,13]. DME can be obtained in two
ways: direct synthesis and through the methanol dehydration process. The ﬁrst method’s
reactions are:
CO + 2H2 ⇄ CH3OH
(1)
2CH3OH ⇄ CH3OCH3 + H2O
(2)
H2O + CO ⇄ H2 + CO2
(3)
The process of direct DME synthesis is exothermic (c.a. 246.2 kJ/mol DME); therefore,
the heat produced during the reactions has to be removed. The inlet reactant mixture is
composed of CO and H2.
Methanol dehydration to produce DME is also an exothermic process. CO2 can be
used to produce methanol and then dehydrate it to DME. This has been proven to be a very
economical way of utilizing carbon dioxide [2,14,15]. The chemical reactions occurring
during the process are presented below:

In Ref. [16], the authors explored the proﬁtability of DME production from biogas; in
Ref. [17], a techno-economic assessment of bio-DME and bio-methanol production from
oil palm residue was proposed. Methanol is a colourless, ﬂammable liquid under ambient
conditions with a characteristic odour. As one of the most important raw materials, it is
a substrate in many syntheses of chemical compounds, including formaldehyde, acetic
acid and chloromethane. It is also a very good solvent and it is easily miscible with water,
alcohols and organic solvents. Due to its wide application in many industries (fuel, chemical
and other industries), the demand for methanol is constantly growing, i.e., from 47 Mt/a
in 2011 [18] to 100 Mt/a in 2021 [19]. According to the report made by the International
Renewable Energy Agency [19], in 2021, only 0.2% of global production of methanol came
from renewable sources—more than 60% was converted by natural gas reformation and
the rest was produced by natural coal gasiﬁcation.
Methanol can be synthesized from a gas containing either carbon monoxide or carbon
dioxide when it reacts with hydrogen:
CO2 + 3H2 ⇄ CH3OH + H2O
(8)
CO + 2H2 ⇄ CH3OH
(9)
The main properties of DME and methanol in comparison with LNG and diesel oil are
shown in Table 1. Moreover, several potential major applications of DME and methanol are
shown below in Figures 1 and 2.

State-of-the-Art Production of DME/Methanol from Green Hydrogen and CO2
Converting CO2 into DME requires an energy input in the form of hydrogen, as
shown in Equations (1)–(9). In order to meet the goal of reducing carbon emissions, green
hydrogen is needed [1,5,26,27].
Hydrogen can be synthesized in different ways: chemical, biological, catalytic, electro-
chemical and thermal. To reduce the carbon footprint of the CCU process, a low-emission
hydrogen production technology has to be applied. Among several possible approaches,
the production of “green hydrogen” using an electrolyser powered by a renewable energy
source is the most interesting [28,29].
Barbato et al. [24] presented a process for carbon dioxide conversion to green methanol
where CO2 captured from a power plant was combined with hydrogen from an electrolyser

powered by hydropower energy. In the calculations and conclusions, the price (with cost
calculations at the prevailing rate) of methanol production resulted to be 294 €/ton and it
was successfully reduced by 20% compared to the price of methanol produced traditionally.
While there are a number of pilot or demonstration-scale facilities, there are a few
commercial units producing either DME or methanol on an industrial scale. Regarding
existing facilities with a power plant as a carbon dioxide source, two projects developed in
Germany can be taken into consideration.
The ﬁrst was funded by Europe’s Horizon 2020 program (MefCO2, Project No. 637016).
Nine partners established in 2014 an international cooperation to research the feasibility of
CCU technology along with the production of green methanol. The main aims of the project
were to demonstrate the economic feasibility of utilizing captured CO2 by converting it
into a usable fuel, such as methanol, and further providing green hydrogen produced
from excess energy from renewable sources. The source of carbon dioxide was a lignite-
ﬁred power plant located in Niederaussem, Germany. The project ended in 2019 with the
development of one of the largest facilities in the European Union to synthesize methanol
from CO2 from ﬂue gases, capable of producing 1 ton of methanol per day while capturing
more than 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide per day [30–37].
Carbon Recycling International Ltd. (CRI, Reykjavik, Iceland), known for producing
renewable methanol since 2007, participated in this project. CRI’s pilot unit is located near
Iceland’s capital—Reykjavik. Industrial-scale green methanol production began in 2012 in
the ﬁrst pilot plant with an annual capacity of about 4000 tonnes of methanol (c.a. 12 t/d).
The process is based on the conversion of CO2 from geothermal sources with the hydrogen
produced by water electrolysis using geothermal energy [1,36,38]. The methanol produced
in this facility is used in a number of applications, including blending with gasoline,
biodiesel production, and wastewater denitriﬁcation. Additionally, the CRI methanol
production process reduces the environmental impact by 90% compared to conventional
methods [19]. Furthermore, CRI, in cooperation with China Henan Shuncheng Group,
developed in 2021 the world’s ﬁrst green methanol plant with a capacity of 110,000 tons
per year [39].
The ALIGN-CCUS (Project No 271501) demonstration plant is also located at Nieder-
aussem, Germany. The project was funded through the ERA-NET ACT program and it was
co-funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 program ACT [40]. The
source of the captured CO2 is a 1000 MW power plant unit, and the hydrogen comes from
a 140 kWel alkaline electrolyser providing 22 kg of hydrogen per day. The daily production
of DME is about 50 kg. For DME synthesis, a Mitsubishi Power bifunctional catalyst was
used, which was responsible for both methanol synthesis and the dehydration process [41].
In this paper, we evaluate the energetic performance of a DME and methanol syn-
thesis process fuelled by the CO2 captured from a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC)
power plant and by the green hydrogen produced using an electrolyser (alkaline). The
process conﬁguration performance is assessed by means of an exergetic analysis and com-
pared to a post-combustion CCS. Through exergy, these two different processes can be
evaluated [42–44], assessing the quality degradation of energy and individuating sources
of irreversibility.
The post-combustion CCS is a common basis to compare new strategies to avoid
carbon emissions. Olaleye et al. deeply discussed post-combustion carbon capture from a
coal-ﬁred power plant [45,46].
Blumbert et al. presented an NG-based low-pressure synthesis process for the pro-
duction of methanol with CO2 utilization [47]. In their paper, the authors conducted an
extended exergy analysis dividing the methanol production plant into various subsystems
and evaluated the performance of each of them. Nakyai et al. [48] conducted an energy
and exergy analysis of the DME production from CO and CO2 in a single-stage process.
Farooqui et al. [49] evaluated from an energetic and an exergetic point of view a poly-
generation plant with oxyfuel carbon capture for combined power and DME production.
In our paper, we proposed a new conﬁguration for DME and methanol production in a
Energies 2022, 15, 3516

single-stage process, in which a 90% CO2 conversion rate was achieved. We compared this
process with post-combustion CCS and evaluated all of the chain from the NGCC power
plant to the DME and methanol production. Through the exergetic analysis, we spotted the
irreversibilities, calculated the conventional performance indicators [45–47] and deﬁned
new performance indicators to assess the goodness of our conﬁguration with respect to
energy transformation and exergy destruction.
The proposed conﬁguration is described in Section 2. Section 3 introduces the adopted
methodology and the process assumptions that were made. Section 4 presents the results
of the exergy analysis and Section 5 gathers the main conclusions of the work.
2. Systems Description
In this section, the proposed system to reduce carbon emissions and to produce
valuable products, such as DME and methanol, is described (Figure 3). The carbon dioxide-
emitting source is a natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plant whose ﬂue gas
is washed with an MDEA water solution to capture the CO2 (refer to Section 2.1). The
recovered carbon dioxide is partly stored underground and partly converted into DME and
methanol, reported in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.

Capture (PCCC) is depicted in Figure 4. The parameters and process conﬁguration are

and assumptions are listed in Table 2.
The Heat-Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) of the power plant has three pressure levels:
•
4.6 bar, low pressure (LP);
•
40 bar, intermediate pressure (IP);
•
150 bar, high pressure (HP).

The outlet steam of the low-pressure turbine (LT) is condensed and fed to the deaerator
unit with the condensate pump (CP) at 3 bar. Here, a vent is purged and the liquid collected
at the bottom is pressurized at 4.6 bar with the low-pressure pump (LPP) before being
mixed with the almost-saturated liquid water from the reboiler of the stripper column
in the PCCC unit. The resulting liquid stream is partially vaporized in the HRSG. The
liquid and vapour are separated, the vapour fraction is further heated in the HRSG, the
liquid fraction is once again split, one part is fed to the intermediate pressure pump (IPP)
and the other part to the high-pressure pump (HPP). Both pressurized liquids are heated
in the HRSG; a fraction of the IP liquid is used to preheat the natural gas entering the
combustion chamber and recirculate it with the saturated water from the reboiler of the
stripper. The HP superheated steam is expanded in the high-pressure turbine (HT) to
40 bar; it is then mixed with the IP superheated steam and reheated in the HRSG. The
resulting IP superheated steam is expanded in the intermediate-pressure turbine (IT) to the
LP level and again mixed with the LP superheated steam. The resulting stream is split to
feed both the stripper reboiler and the deaerator. The remaining fraction is expanded in
the LT.
The oxidant in the natural gas combustion is air, which is compressed at 18.2 bar in a
three-stage intercooled compressor. After combustion, the ﬂue gas is expanded in a turbine
(GT) until 1.03 bar [50]. The gas leaves the GT and enters the HRSG at 898 K, where it is
cooled to 437 K. The heat recovered in the HRSG supplies the Rankine cycle. In the HRSG,
the ﬂue gas is cooled to 303 K and subsequently compressed in a two-stage intercooled
compressor at 4 bar to be fed to the PCCC unit. Condensed water is expelled at the outlet
of each compression–refrigeration stage.
Flue gas is fed to an absorber working at 3.8 bar from the bottom of the column. In
the outlet section, the CO2-rich stream is sent to a stripper, where the weak bond between
MDEA and CO2 is thermally broken in the reboiler. The lean solvent is collected at the
bottom of the stripper and recirculated to the absorber, while almost-pure CO2 is collected
at the top of the stripper.
In particular, the polytropic coefﬁcient for compressors was set to equal 0.9215 for the
inter-refrigerated stages and equal 0.9315 for the non-inter-refrigerated ones.
2.2. Underground Storage
One route to avoid carbon emissions is the underground storage of the captured CO2.
This is accomplished by purifying and pressurizing the CO2 collected at the top of the
stripper. Carbon dioxide can be stored at different thermodynamic conditions. In this work,
we supposed storing it as a supercritical liquid. Therefore, the gas stream containing pure
CO2 was pressurized at 153 bar in a ﬁve-stage intercooled compressor. Carbon dioxide was
liqueﬁed and stored at 153 bar and 303 K. The overall scheme is presented in Figure 5 and
the main inputs, outputs and assumptions are listed in Table 3.

2.3. DME Production Plant
As an alternative to total carbon dioxide geological storage, we considered carbon
utilization for dimethyl ether (DME) production in a single-step reaction process. In this
conﬁguration, the DME production plant is fed with 25% of the total CO2, leaving the
remaining share destined to the underground storage as in the previously described case.
Figure 6 shows the CO2 conversion process scheme. A gaseous stream of CO2 collected at
the top of the stripper in the PCCC unit is puriﬁed and pressurized at 30 bar in a four-step
intercooled compressor [51]. Then, the stream from the compressor is mixed with a pure H2
stream and the stream recirculated from the top of the distillation column and containing
CO2 and H2. The ﬂow rate of H2 has the value needed to achieve a hydrogen to carbon
ratio (H/C) equal to 3. Then, the H2–CO2 mixture is heated up to 473.15 K and fed to the
reactor, where the reactions of CO2 hydrogenation, water–gas shift and methanol (MeOH)
dehydration happen [51]:
CO2 + 3H2 ⇄ CH3OH + H2O
∆H0 = −49.4 kJ/mol

The heat generated by the exothermic reactions is removed from the reactor in order
to maintain the temperature reaction constant at 473.15 K and supplied to the reboiler of
column C-1. The duty from the reboiler covers around 43% of the thermal demand at
the reboiler of column C-1. Then, the reaction products are cooled at 440 K in two heat
Energies 2022, 15, 3516
10 of 20
exchangers. The heat exchanger HE2 supplies the duty of the column C-3 reboiler, while
the heat exchanger HE3 provides the heat needed by the column C-2 reboiler. After being
cooled, the reaction products enter column C-1 at 21.3 bar. Here the heavy compounds,
MeOH and water, are separated from the light ones (DME, CO, CO2 and H2). The light
compounds are collected at the top of C-1 as a vaporous mixture and fed to column C-2
operating at 19 bar to separate the DME. The distillate of column C-2 contains unreacted
CO, CO2 and H2, which are recycled to the reactor for 95% of their amount in the distillate,
the remaining part enters a PSA to extract the hydrogen in it. Eighty percent of the
hydrogen in the PSA is collected at the outlet section. The overall rate of CO2 conversion
is around 90%. MeOH and water are collected at the bottom of column C-1 as a liquid
mixture and separated in column C-3 operating at 1.8 bar. Both columns C-1 and C-2
have partial condensers at their top stages working below the environmental temperature.
In particular, the condensing temperatures at C-1 and C-2 are 262.48 K and 246.89 K,
respectively. Therefore, refrigeration cycles are used to reach these temperatures, and 3.14
is the value supposed for the Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) of both cycles [52]. The
overall scheme is presented in Figure 6 and the main inputs, outputs and assumptions are
listed in Table 4.

3. Assumptions and Methodology
All processes were simulated with the software Aspen Plus V10. The Peng–Robinson
model was applied to the Brayton–Joule cycle of the power plant, while the Steam–Table
model was chosen for the Rankine cycle of the plant. To control the process, eight design
speciﬁcations were introduced to adjust the temperature at the outlet of the GT, the pinch
temperature differences in the HRSG, the vent purge in the deaerator, the water make-up
and the steam to be sent at the reboiler of the stripper in the PCCC unit. A calculator
was used to evaluate the power generated by the plant. The natural gas properties were
taken from [51]. The combustion chamber was simulated with an RGibbs reactor, which
minimized the Gibbs free energy, and the deaerator with a Flash2 separator.
With respect to the PCCC unit, for all of the blocks within this unit, the ENRT-RK
model was used, which consisted of an unsymmetric electrolyte NRTL model with the
Redlich–Kwong equation of state and Henry’s law for electrolyte systems. The electrolyte
species were due to the presence of the amine MDEA as solvent.
To control the PCCC process, four design speciﬁcations were introduced to adjust the
CO2 content in the gas stream leaving the absorber from the top, the molar composition of
the residue of the stripper, the water make-up and the solvent make-up. The absorber was
simulated with a RadFrac column with no condenser nor reboiler of 10 theoretical stages
working at 3.8 bar. The stripper was simulated with a RadFrac column too, without the
Energies 2022, 15, 3516
11 of 20
condenser, but with a Kettle reboiler fed with the LP steam from the power plant. It had
ﬁve theoretical stages and a working pressure of 1.1 bar.
Regarding the DME production plant, the NRTL and the Peng–Robinson models were
implemented. The former was for the distillation columns, which worked below 20 bar,
and the latter was used for the other blocks, which worked at higher pressures. The single-
stage reactor was modelled with an RGibbs reactor minimizing the Gibbs free energy with
an implemented temperature approach of equilibrium of 20 K. The distillation columns
used to separate the reaction products were all modelled with the RadFrac column. Every
distillation column had 15 theoretical stages and a Kettle reboiler. Columns C-1 and C-2
were equipped with a partial condenser and their distillate was vaporous, while column
C-3 had a total condenser providing a liquid distillate. DME was the primary product of
the plant, while MeOH was a secondary product. The simulation included seven design
speciﬁcations with the objective of setting the molar ratio between hydrogen and carbon at
the inlet of the reactor and the distillates’ ﬂow rate and purity at each distillation column.
The exergy analysis with the aim of evaluating thermodynamics inefﬁciencies and rig-
orous performances of the process was based on the conventional methodology described
in the following and found in some similar papers [45,47].
The ambient conditions were assumed at 298.15 K and 1.013 bar. The exergy ﬂow
rate Ei of the i-th stream was the sum of the physical and chemical exergies, as reported in
Equation (13), and was obtainable from the Aspen Plus simulations, while the kinetic and
potential exergies were neglected. For further details, please refer to [44].

The exergy destruction rate in the j-th component was calculated as follows:
ED,j = EF,j + EP,j
(14)
where EF,j, EP,j and ED,j are respectively the exergy of the streams fed to the j-th component,
the exergy of the streams leaving the j-th component, and the exergy destroyed in the j-th
component. Table 5 shows how EF,j and EP,j were deﬁned for each component.

4. Results and Discussion
Exergy analysis was performed to detect the inefﬁciencies of the proposed process
scheme, to locate the elements showing interesting improvement potentials and to compare
the suggested hybrid solution (Route 1) to the complete underground storage (Route 2).
The power plant and the PCCC were analysed with a process-integrated approach as
they represented the common path for both process conﬁgurations. Instead, a very de-
tailed exergy analysis on the underground storage unit and on the DME production plant
was performed.

For every component j in the DME production plant, the exergy destruction ED,j and
the parameters δj and γj were calculated based on the method reported in Table 5.
The exergetic efﬁciencies of the different units were calculated as follows:
ηBJ = WNET,BJ + EHRSG
E2
(19)
ηR = WNET,R + EReb
EHRSG
(20)
ηPCCC =

(22)
ηDME =
E19 + E20 + E21 + E22
E13 + E14 + WDME + EF,HE1 + EF,C−3
(23)
where WNET,BJ and WNET,R are the net electric power in the Brayton–Joule and Rankine
cycles, EHRSG is the exergy exchanged in the Heat Recovery Steam Generator, Ei is the
exergy associated with the i-th stream in Figure 4, EReb is the exergy exported to the reboiler
of the stripper in the PCCC unit, and WPCCC and WDME are the electric power demand in
the PCCC and DME production plant units, respectively. The exergy associated with the
compressor of the off gas (stream no. 3 in Figure 4) was counted in the PCCC unit. The
heat exchanger HE1 in Figure 6 heated up the reactants to 473.15 K; such an amount of heat
was not recovered from anywhere in the process and it was supposed to be provided by a
hot source at a constant temperature of 488.15 K. Instead, HE2 and HE3 supplied the heat
Energies 2022, 15, 3516

at the reboilers of C-3 and C-2 respectively. Approximately 42.65% of the heat needed at
the reboiler of C-3 was supplied by the exothermic reactions (1)–(3). The remaining part
was supposed to be provided by a hot source at a constant temperature of 479.64 K (15 K
higher than the temperature at the reboiler of C-3). Therefore, the values of EF,HE1 and of
EF,C−3 were calculated as shown in [54].
The values of ηBJ, ηR, ηPCC, ηUS and ηDME, as well as the values of the destroyed
exergies in the unit, are listed in Table 7, where the results of the exergy analysis of the
different units are listed. The destroyed exergy in each unit was given by the difference
between the denominator and the nominator of the corresponding exergy efﬁciency.

Figures 7 and 8 show the result of the exergy analysis of the DME production plant. The
distillation column C-1 was mainly responsible for the exergy destruction, as it represented
45.19% of all exergy destruction, and its impact on exergy fuel reduction was worth 12.37%.
In particular, the refrigeration cycle at the top stage of C-1 was the operation associated
with the highest irreversibility, as shown in Figure 9. These values were higher than those of
columns C-2 and C-3, because column C-1 dealt with higher ﬂow rates and separated very
different chemical species. Furthermore, as shown in Table 6, much of the stream fed to
column C-1 left the column from the top at a temperature lower than the feed temperature.
This fact determines the high exergy destruction in the column C-1 condenser. The reactor
was the second-most responsible unit for exergy destruction, and column C-3 was the third.
In particular, the exergy destruction associated with column C-3 was due to the difference
in the speciﬁc exergy ξ of the streams. This is shown in Table 6; in fact, the speciﬁc exergy
of the residue ξ22 was lower than the speciﬁc exergy of the feed ξ18 and speciﬁcally of the
distillate ξ21, but the mass ﬂow of the residue was almost ﬁve times the mass ﬂow of the
distillate. The exergy destruction associated with the reactor was also due to the chemical
exergy difference in reagents and products.

4.2. Comparison with CO2 Underground Storage (Route 2)
The results of the previous section are hereby compared with the Route 2 solution
to avoid carbon emissions, i.e., 100% underground storage of recovered CO2. The same
power plant and PCCC were analysed; therefore the results for those units were the same
as those in Route 1. The recovered carbon dioxide was supposed to be treated in order to
be completely stored in geological sites. The thermodynamic properties of the material
streams of the power plant and PCCC units in Table 6 are still valid. Figure 11 shows the
exergy destructions distribution among the units.
Figure 11. Distribution of exergy destruction between the units (total ED = 541.42 MW).
The same conditions for temperature and pressure were set for the underground
stored carbon dioxide in both routes, as shown in Tables 6 and 8. Therefore, the exergy
efﬁciencies of the underground storage unit in Route 1 and in Route 2 were the same, but
exergy destruction in this case accounted for 4.33 MW.

The results show a decrease in the total exergy destruction of 6.88% due to the complete
storage of the recovered carbon dioxide. Focusing on the units treating the recovered CO2,
the destroyed exergy in Route 2 was approximately a tenth of the destroyed exergy in
Route 1 (44.34 MW). Despite the consistent reduction in the destroyed exergy, the DME
production plant unit had higher exergy efﬁciency than the underground storage unit. The
process’ intrinsic exergy efﬁciency was higher, but the additional use of high-value energy
and material streams increased the overall exergy destruction. The exergy efﬁciencies and
the destroyed exergy per non-emitted CO2 coefﬁcient are presented in Table 9 for the units
treating the recovered CO2.

Furthermore, the DME production plant unit was able to release available energy to
the environment in the form of DME and MeOH streams. This energy value was quantiﬁed
with the lower heating value of material streams 20 and 21 in Figure 6. The energy gain
(EG) we obtained from DME and MeOH production in the DME production plant was
calculated as the ratio between the sum of the energy transported by streams 20 and 21 and
the exergy destroyed in the Route 1 CO2-treating units:
EG = m20LHV20 + m21LHV21
ED,US + ED,DME
(24)
The EG value is 2.276 MJ/MJ; in particular, it was 1.875 MJ/MJ for DME production
and 0.401 MJ/MJ for MeOH production.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, an exergy analysis of a process conﬁguration able to avoid carbon
emissions and to produce DME and methanol is presented. The carbon-emitting source
in this study was a 189 MW power plant. The Brayton–Joule cycle in the power plant
was mainly responsible for exergy destruction, 75% of the produced carbon dioxide was
captured to be stored underground and the remaining 25% was to be transformed into
DME and methanol via reactions with hydrogen. In the plant, the total CO2 generated
by the power cycle was 119,068 kg/h, the amount stored was 89,288 kg/h, the stream
converted was 26,815 kg/h and the amount vented to the atmosphere was 2965 kg/h (2.5%
of the total). The reaction sections converted the CO2 stream into DME (10,381 kg/h) and
methanol (3214.1 kg/h). A second route was considered, i.e., the storage of 100% of the
CO2 generated by the power plant.
Of those two routes to avoid carbon emissions, the underground storage offers a much
lower exergy destruction per mass of non-emitted carbon. Inside the DME production plant,
the main contribution to exergy destruction was from the distillation column separating
the reactor outlet stream and, in particular, the top-stage condenser was found to be the
component with the highest irreversibility. This DME synthesis showed a higher efﬁciency
than the underground storage unit, but a higher exergy destruction per non-emitted carbon
dioxide ratio. As a consequence, the process conﬁguration we propose has higher exergetic
efﬁciency and exergy destruction than full geological storage, and produces valuable
compounds, such as DME and methanol. Its feasibility is strictly correlated with the
Energies 2022, 15, 3516

development of the hydrogen industry, and a future study should evaluate the impact of
hydrogen production at different carbon dioxide shares between DME production and
underground storage. Future works should investigate the optimal CO2 split between
Route 1 and Route 2 and extend exergy analysis to green hydrogen production.
