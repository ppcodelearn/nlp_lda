Abstract: Synthesis of methanol from recirculated CO2 and H2 produced by water electrolysis allows
sustainable production of fuels and chemical storage of energy. Production of renewable methanol
has, however, not achieved commercial breakthrough, and novel methods to improve economic
feasibility are needed. One possibility is to alter the reaction route to methanol using catalytic
alcoholic solvents, which makes the process possible at lower reaction temperatures. To estimate the
techno-economic potential of this approach, the feasibilities of the conventional gas-phase process
and an alternative liquid-phase process employing 2-butanol or 1-butanol solvents were compared by
means of ﬂowsheet modelling and economic analysis. As a result, it was found that despite improved
methanol yield, the presence of solvent adds complexity to the process and increases separation costs
due to the high volatility of the alcohols and formation of azeotropes. Hydrogen, produced from
wind electricity, was the major cost in all processes. The higher cost of the present, non-optimized
liquid-phase process is largely explained by the heat required in separation. If this heat could be
provided by heat integration, the resulting production costs approach the costs of the gas-phase
process. It is concluded that the novel reaction route provides promising possibilities, but new
breakthroughs in process synthesis, integration, optimization, and catalysis are needed before the
alcoholic solvent approach surpasses the traditional gas-phase process.

1. Introduction
The synthesis of liquid fuels from hydrogen using captured CO2 as the carbon source would allow
sustainable fuel production with the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in the energy and transportation
sectors [1], while simultaneously providing an option for the chemical storage of intermittent renewable
electricity [2]. Such an approach could potentially make a signiﬁcant contribution to decarbonization
of the energy system [3]. Methanol provides an example of such a liquid energy carrier [4].
Methanol is both an important industrial chemical and a useful multi-purpose fuel [5]. It can also
be readily converted into products such as gasoline in the methanol-to-gasoline process (MTG) [6]
or oleﬁns in the methanol-to-oleﬁns process (MTO) [7]. At present, most methanol comes from the
catalytic conversion of synthesis gas (syngas) that is usually generated by steam reforming of natural
gas [8]. The syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, CO, and CO2, is converted into methanol on copper
and zinc oxide (Cu/ZnO)-based catalysts at temperatures of 200–300 ◦C and pressures of 50–100 bar.
The methanol synthesis process can be described by three equilibrium reactions:
CO2 + 3H2 ⇌ CH3OH + H2O
∆H0 = −49.8 kJ/mol
(1)

CO2 + 2H2 ⇌ CH3OH
∆H0 = −91.0 kJ/mol
(2)
CO + H2O ⇌ CO2 + H2
∆H0 = −41.2 kJ/mol
(3)
Equations (1) and (2) represent the exothermic hydrogenation of CO2 and CO to methanol, and
Equation (3) represents the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction that is activated by the copper-based
methanol synthesis catalysts [8]. As Reactions (1) and (2) are exothermic and result in a reduction
of molar volume, methanol synthesis is favored at low temperatures and high pressures. However,
suﬃciently fast reaction kinetics requires temperatures above 200 ◦C, and methanol conversion is thus
limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium.
Alternative to syngas, methanol can be produced by directly hydrogenating pure CO2 with
H2 with high selectivity on conventional Cu/ZnO-based catalysts. However, the reaction rates are
lower than with syngas feeds [9]. The equilibrium conversions are also lower compared to CO
hydrogenation [10]. In addition to the thermodynamic limitation, methanol synthesis from pure CO2 is
complicated because of the increased water formation. In the absence of CO, water is produced both as
the by-product of CO2 hydrogenation (Equation (1)) and by the reverse-water gas shift reaction (reverse
of Equation (3)). The increased formation of water leads to kinetic inhibition [11] and accelerated
deactivation [12] of the Cu/ZnO catalysts.
The economic feasibility of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has been explored in a number
of studies. While some studies paid close attention to the design and modelling of the methanol
synthesis process [13–16], others focused on the electrolysis technology [17], electricity sources [18,19],
or grid-scale implementation in a future renewable-based energy system [20]. Some studies have
considered sustainability and environmental metrics in more detail [21,22]. Comparisons of methanol
against other alternative energy carrier compounds have also been made [23].
Concerning the
economics of the process, however, these studies draw signiﬁcantly diﬀerent conclusions. For example,
Mignard et al. [13] and Anicic et al. [15] found the methanol production costs from CO2 to be potentially
competitive with fossil-based methanol production. In contrast, Pérez-Fortes [16] and Tremel et al. [23]
found the production costs to be substantially higher than current methanol market prices. The overall
costs have generally been found to be dominated by the hydrogen production costs, which consist of
the electrolyzer capital costs and the cost of electricity.
There have been attempts to lower methanol processing costs by replacing the conventional
gas-phase process with alternative liquid-phase processes. In the LPMeOH (liquid-phase methanol)
process, the reaction is carried out in inert hydrocarbon solvent, allowing eﬀective heat control
of the exothermic reaction [24]. A demonstration-scale process has shown stable performance in
conversion of coal-derived syngas with varying composition. Alternatively, methanol synthesis in
co-catalytic alcoholic solvents has also been presented [25,26]. In the alcoholic solvent, methanol
synthesis proceeds by an altered reaction mechanism via the formate ester of the alcohol, allowing
lowered reaction temperatures. The lower temperature in turn allows higher equilibrium conversion
in methanol synthesis.
The kinetics of the alcohol-promoted methanol synthesis process has been widely studied at
the laboratory scale [25,26]. However, the techno-economic potential of this novel process has not
been thoroughly examined. The aim of the present study is to assess the techno-economic feasibility
of the liquid-phase alcohol-based process of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. For this purpose,
the alcohol-promoted process with two alternative solvents is compared to the gas-phase process by
means of process ﬂowsheet simulation and subsequent economic analysis. 2-Butanol was selected
as the primary solvent due to the good catalytic performance shown in experimental studies [27,28].
However, 1-butanol was also considered to assess whether a higher solvent boiling point would
be favorable for the overall process eﬃciency and economics. It should be noted that published
experimental details on the alcohol-promoted process are relatively limited, and the thermodynamics
and kinetics have not been established in detail. Thus, the present work aims to provide a preliminary
feasibility analysis rather than a rigorous optimization of the process alternatives. The key objectives

are to provide useful information for further development of the alcohol-promoted methanol synthesis
process and to clarify its potential at the industrial scale.
2. Materials and Methods
Steady-state models of the processes for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol were created in Aspen
Plus (V9, AspenTech, Bedford, MA, USA). The processes studied included a gas-phase process and
liquid-phase processes in alternative alcoholic solvents 2-butanol and 1-butanol. Mass and energy
balances were generated and used to evaluate the technical performance of each process. The capital
and operating costs of each process were estimated and compared and used to calculate the net present
value (NPV) over the project lifetime. The boundaries of the present work are summarized in Figure 1.
The design and costing of the CO2 capture and water electrolysis units are outside the scope of the
analysis, and the economic analysis was based on the referenced costs of CO2 and hydrogen.

2.1. Modelling Details 
The capacity of the methanol synthesis unit is based on the amount of hydrogen available from 
the electrolysis unit powered by wind electricity at a 30-MW capacity. This capacity was selected as 
being representative of current wind energy projects in Finland [29].  
The high-pressure sections (&gt;10 bar) of each process were modelled in Aspen Plus using the 
RKSMHV2 (Redlich-Kwong-Soave with modified Huron-Vidal mixing rules) property method and 
the low-pressure sections using the NRTL-RK (Non-random two-liquid-Redlich-Kwong) property 
method. The property methods were selected following the guidelines given in Aspen Plus and 
taking into account the temperature, pressure, and polarity of the reaction system. All compressors 
were modelled with polytropic efficiency of 0.85 and mechanical efficiency of 0.95. Pumps were 
modelled at 0.85 pump efficiency and 0.95 driver efficiency. Heat exchangers were modelled by the 
shortcut method. The minimum temperature approach was set to 10 °C for liquid-liquid, 15 °C for 
gas-liquid, and 30 °C for gas-gas exchangers, and the pressure drop in each exchanger was set to 2% 
[30]. Distillation columns were modelled using the rigorous RADFRAC model in equilibrium mode. 
The reactor in the gas-phase process was modelled using the RPLUG block model with an 
adiabatic setting. A relatively low inlet pressure of 50 bar was selected in order to facilitate 
comparison to the liquid-phase processes. The kinetics of the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and 
the water-gas shift reaction were estimated according to the model by Vanden Bussche and Froment

2.1. Modelling Details
The capacity of the methanol synthesis unit is based on the amount of hydrogen available from
the electrolysis unit powered by wind electricity at a 30-MW capacity. This capacity was selected as
being representative of current wind energy projects in Finland [29].
The high-pressure sections (&gt;10 bar) of each process were modelled in Aspen Plus using the
RKSMHV2 (Redlich-Kwong-Soave with modiﬁed Huron-Vidal mixing rules) property method and
the low-pressure sections using the NRTL-RK (Non-random two-liquid-Redlich-Kwong) property
method. The property methods were selected following the guidelines given in Aspen Plus and taking
into account the temperature, pressure, and polarity of the reaction system. All compressors were
modelled with polytropic eﬃciency of 0.85 and mechanical eﬃciency of 0.95. Pumps were modelled at
0.85 pump eﬃciency and 0.95 driver eﬃciency. Heat exchangers were modelled by the shortcut method.
The minimum temperature approach was set to 10 ◦C for liquid-liquid, 15 ◦C for gas-liquid, and 30 ◦C
for gas-gas exchangers, and the pressure drop in each exchanger was set to 2% [30]. Distillation
columns were modelled using the rigorous RADFRAC model in equilibrium mode.
The reactor in the gas-phase process was modelled using the RPLUG block model with an adiabatic
setting. A relatively low inlet pressure of 50 bar was selected in order to facilitate comparison to the
liquid-phase processes. The kinetics of the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and the water-gas shift
reaction were estimated according to the model by Vanden Bussche and Froment [31] with readjusted

parameters by Mignard and Pritchard [32] and implemented in Aspen Plus as described by Van-Dal
and Bouallou [14]. The reactor consisted of 1000 tubes with a length of 2 m and diameter of 0.05 m. The
catalyst bed voidage was set at 0.4, particle density at 1775 kg/m3, and particle diameter at 0.0055 m [14].
The pressure drop was calculated by the Ergun equation.
A bubble column reactor similar to the one utilized in the LPMeOH liquid-phase methanol
synthesis process [24,33] was proposed for the liquid-phase process. The feed gases were bubbled
through the solvent, and the product vapors together with unreacted gases were removed from the
reactor. In the process with alcohol solvents, signiﬁcant evaporation of the solvent took place, and
the solvent vapors were removed together with the product vapors and gases. The solvent was then
separated in downstream processing and returned to the reactor. Due to the lack of any detailed kinetic
model for the alcohol promoted reaction route, the reactor in all liquid-phase processes was modelled
with the RCSTR block based on the thermodynamic equilibrium by Gibbs energy minimization. In the
model, CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and the reverse-water gas shift were assumed as equilibrium
reactions with the 0 ◦C approach to equilibrium. The reactor was operated isothermally at 180 ◦C and
50 bar, with reactions taking place in the liquid phase.
The sizing of the reactor for capital cost estimation was based on the speciﬁc methanol formation
rate of 0.17 kg/(l h) reported by Tsubaki et al. for Cu/ZnO catalyst in ethanol solvent [34]. This rate
was achieved in laboratory experiments under kinetics-controlled conditions with an approximate
catalyst volume fraction of 1% in the slurry. In the present design, the same rate was assumed with
a catalyst volume fraction of 10%, as limitations by mass and heat transfer are likely in a large-scale
bubble column reactor. The same rate was also assumed regardless of the alcohol used as the solvent.
The results of the reactor sizing are presented in Section 3.1.
2.2. Environmental Impact Analysis
The environmental impact of the alternative processes was assessed in terms of the CO2 balance,
electricity consumption, and water balance. In the calculation of the CO2 balance, the amount of
CO2 fed to the process was subtracted from the sum of direct and indirect CO2 emissions related to
the process. These emissions consisted of CO2 present in outlet streams, the CO2 emitted in steam
generation, and the indirect emissions of grid electricity. The speciﬁc electricity consumption (per t
MeOH) of the processes was calculated, and the corresponding CO2 emission was estimated from the
carbon intensity of the Finnish electricity grid at the time of writing (170 g CO2/kWh) [35]. For steam
generation, emissions from both the combustion of externally-supplied fuel (natural gas) and the
combustion of process waste streams were considered. Cooling water input and waste water output
were considered in the water balance. The mass ﬂow rate and composition of the waste water streams,
consisting of water/alcohol mixtures, were assessed.
2.3. Cost Estimation
The following section describes the methods used and the assumptions made in the evaluation of
the capital and operating costs of the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol processes.
2.3.1. Capital Costs
The capital costs were estimated by the factorial method according to Towler and Sinnott [36].
The installed equipment costs for the estimation were obtained from the cost functions integrated into
the Aspen Plus software. The installed costs in USD were converted to Euros at the exchange rate of
0.89 €/USD (2018). The installed costs were further corrected for construction from SS304 stainless steel
by a material factor of 1.3 [36] and by a location factor of 1.043 corresponding to Western Europe [16].
The reactor’s cost in the liquid-phase process was based on the sizing procedure described above.
A 50% contingency was added on top of the cost of the pressure vessel in order to account for auxiliary
equipment such as heat transfer equipment, slurry handling, and catalyst activation. The reactor cost
Processes 2019, 7, 405
5 of 24
was identical in all the liquid-phase processes, as the eﬀect of diﬀerent solvents on the reaction rate
and the resulting reactor volume was not considered.
The corrected installed equipment costs corresponded to the inside battery limits (ISBL) capital
costs comprising the purchase and installation of all the main and auxiliary process equipment.
The oﬀsite (OSBL) capital costs, including the infrastructure and site improvements, were calculated as
25% of the ISBL capital costs. The plant would be preferably located on an existing fuel production site
with readily-available infrastructure. Engineering costs were estimated as 20% of the sum of the ISBL
and OSBL costs. Finally, a contingency of 30% of the sum of ISBL and OSBL costs was added to obtain
the total ﬁxed capital cost (TFCC). The working capital was estimated as 15% of the sum of the ISBL
and OSBL costs. The factorial method of capital cost estimation is summarized in Table 1.

To calculate its contribution to the total methanol production cost, the total ﬁxed capital cost was
annualized based on an assumed plant lifetime of 20 years and an interest rate of 5%.
2.3.2. Variable and Fixed Operating Costs
The overall cost of hydrogen production, including capital and operating costs of both the 30-MW
wind farm and the alkaline electrolysis unit and the hydrogen storage costs, was assumed to be
3000 €/t of hydrogen. This value was based on a 2006 report by Levene et al. [37], which estimated that
the production cost of wind-based hydrogen was in the range of $2.90–3.40/kg, including hydrogen
storage. The production cost of wind electricity in the Finnish scenario has been recently estimated at
41.4 €/MWh [38]. This value is fairly consistent with the wind electricity cost ($0.038/kWh) used by
Levene et al. [37]. The hydrogen cost is also consistent with Smolinka et al. [39], who estimated a value
of 3.17 €/kg for large-scale alkaline electrolysis with intermittent operation (average capacity factor
35%). All the electricity available from the wind farm was utilized in the electrolysis unit. In order to
maintain constant operation, the methanol synthesis unit was powered by grid electricity, available at
an assumed market cost of 60 €/MWh [40]. Electricity consumption of the synthesis unit was calculated
in the Aspen Plus process models.
The cost of CO2 consisted of the capital and operational costs of an amine absorption unit. A cost
of 50 €/t was assumed based on the International Energy Agency report [41]. If the CO2 capture unit is
located at a distance from the electrolysis and synthesis units, CO2 transportation cost should also
be included. However, this was not considered as the transport cost was small compared to the CO2
capture costs [42].
The cost of steam was calculated based on a fuel (natural gas) cost of 30 €/MWh [43] and
boiler eﬃciency of 80%, including heat losses. The fuel cost was calculated for the generation of
medium-pressure (MP) steam at 20 bar (saturation temperature 212 ◦C). The overall cost was corrected
by a factor of 1.3 taking non-fuel costs into account [44]. As a result, a cost of 35 €/t was obtained for
the MP steam, and an identical cost was assumed for the low-pressure (LP) steam at 6 bar (saturation
temperature 159 ◦C). Shaft work or condensate credits were not considered. In process modelling,
MP and LP steam were included as utilities in the Aspen Plus model for calculation of the steam
Processes 2019, 7, 405
6 of 24
consumption rate. Full condensation of steam in exchangers was assumed, and the outlet temperatures
of MP and LP steam were set at 211 ◦C and 158 ◦C, respectively.
Steam generation by waste heat available from the combustion of process waste and purge streams
was also considered. Both gas/vapor and liquid streams suitable for combustion were included in
waste heat generation. Lower heating values of 10.1 MJ/kg for CO, 121 MJ/kg for H2, 19.9 MJ/kg for
methanol, and 34.4 MJ/kg for both 2-butanol and 1-butanol were used in the calculation of the heat
produced [45]. A boiler eﬃciency of 80% was assumed for the waste heat boilers. The steam generated
by the waste heat was utilized in the processes by subtraction of the amount of steam generated from
the process MP steam consumption. In cases where the process produced a net heat output, the steam
generated was considered a by-product with a selling price of 35 €/t.
The consumption rate of cooling water was also calculated in the Aspen Plus process models.
The cost of cooling water was 0.26 €/m3 [42], with an inlet temperature of 20 ◦C and outlet temperature
of 25 ◦C. The cost of waste water was 0.32 €/m3 [42] regardless of the composition of the waste water
streams. Consumables included the methanol synthesis catalyst (assumed cost of 95 €/kg [16] and
lifetime of 4 years) and the solvent make-up. The amount of catalyst used in the gas-phase process
(3.49 t) was calculated based on the volume of the reactor tubes (1000 tubes, length 2 m, diameter 0.05 m),
catalyst density (1775 kg/m3 [14]), and bed porosity (0.5). Assuming a 4-year catalyst lifetime, 0.87 t of
the catalyst needs to be replaced each year, giving a per year cost of approximately 83,000 €, which was
not discounted. The amount and cost of catalyst used in the liquid-phase methanol synthesis processes
was calculated by the reactor sizing procedure described in Section 2.1. The cost of make-up solvent
was assumed to be 500 €/t in the liquid-phase processes, regardless of the alcohol used. A summary of
the variable costs considered is given in Table 2.

Fixed operating costs were calculated according to the factorial method from Towler and
Sinnott [46]. A labor requirement of 4 shift positions with 4 operators per position with a salary of
40,000 €/a was assumed. Supervision was estimated as 25% of labor cost. Labor overheads were
assumed as 45% of the sum of labor and supervision. Maintenance costs were assumed as 3% of the
ISBL capital cost. Plant and company overheads constituted 65% of the labor and maintenance costs,
while taxes and insurance constituted 2% of the total ﬁxed capital cost.
2.3.3. Revenues
A methanol price of 400 €/t [47] was assumed in the economic analysis. Additional revenues from
the sales of oxygen by-product generated in the electrolysis unit were also considered. A conservative
price of 70 €/t [15,18] was assumed for oxygen, and the costs of oxygen compression and liquefaction
were omitted.

2.4. Economic Analysis
The net present value (NPV) of each process was calculated based on the following assumptions.
Plant lifetime was set at 20 years. Thirty percent, 60%, and 10% of the capital costs were distributed to
Years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thirty percent and 70% of revenues and operating costs were considered
during Year 3 and Year 4, and 100% thereafter. One hundred percent of working capital was deployed
during the ﬁrst year. A discount rate of 8% was assumed, and taxes and depreciation were not
considered [16].
2.5. Process Descriptions
The overall process discussed here consisted of the electrolysis unit powered by wind electricity
and the methanol synthesis unit. Options for the methanol synthesis unit included the gas-phase
synthesis process and the liquid-phase synthesis process with alternative solvents (2-butanol and
1-butanol).
2.5.1. Electrolysis and Wind Electricity
The present analysis considered wind electricity in the Finnish scenario [38] for the electrolysis
process. The plant consisting of the electrolysis unit, the methanol synthesis unit, and possibly the
CO2 capture unit was assumed to be located near a land-based wind turbine farm. Transportation of
CO2 was not ruled out, as this location assumption might prove unrealistic. Potential sources of CO2
would consist of fossil power plants and various industrial sources (especially bioprocessing plants in
the Finnish scenario).
Based on available data on current and upcoming wind energy projects in Finland [29],
the electricity generation capacity of the wind farm was set at 30 MW. Due to the signiﬁcant temporal
variation inherent in wind-based electricity generation, the full capacity was not constantly available
for the electrolysis unit. However, a constant supply of hydrogen to the methanol synthesis unit is
required to allow steady-state operation at design capacity. Thus, a suﬃcient capacity for hydrogen
storage for the methanol synthesis unit should be assumed.
Hydrogen was generated by pressurized alkaline electrolysis operating at 30 bar. The capacity of
the electrolysis unit was 30 MW, and the system eﬃciency was 70% [39]. Based on the heat of formation
of water (285.8 MJ/kmol), 264.5 kmol/h of water was split to form an equal amount of hydrogen in
moles. At the 30-bar operating pressure, this corresponds to 533.2 kg/h of hydrogen fed to the methanol
synthesis unit.
2.5.2. Gas-Phase Methanol Synthesis
The ﬂowsheet of the gas-phase methanol synthesis process is presented in Figure 2. At the feed
compression stage, hydrogen was compressed from 30.0 bar (outlet pressure of the alkaline electrolyzer)
to 51 bar in a single stage (COMP5), and CO2 was compressed from 1.0 bar–51.0 bar in four stages
(COMP1–4) with intercooling (COOLER1–3). The pressure ratio of Stages 1–3 equaled 3.0, while the
ﬁnal stage was speciﬁed to the outlet pressure of 51.0 bar. The molar ratio of the fresh feed was three
moles hydrogen per one mole CO2, with mass ﬂows of 533.2 and 3881.7 kg/h, respectively. The feed
gases were mixed with the recycle gas (MIX1), and the mixed feed was preheated to 215.0 ◦C by heat
exchange with the reactor outlet in the heat exchanger HX1. The feed was then converted in the
adiabatic reactor.

four stages (COMP1–4) with intercooling (COOLER1–3). The pressure ratio of Stages 1–3 equaled 3.0, 
while the final stage was specified to the outlet pressure of 51.0 bar. The molar ratio of the fresh feed 
was three moles hydrogen per one mole CO2, with mass flows of 533.2 and 3881.7 kg/h, respectively. 
The feed gases were mixed with the recycle gas (MIX1), and the mixed feed was preheated to 215.0 
°C by heat exchange with the reactor outlet in the heat exchanger HX1. The feed was then converted 
in the adiabatic reactor.

heat exchanger; DIST, distillation column.
The temperature at the reactor outlet was 274.4 ◦C. The outlet gas was split into two fractions in
SPLIT1, with 68% of the gas (Stream 14) used to preheat the feed in HX1. The remaining 32% was
heat integrated with the reboiler of the distillation column and preheated the column feed (HX3).
The two streams were recombined (MIX2) and cooled to 35.0 ◦C in the cooler HX2. The unreacted
gases were separated in the ﬂash drum (FLASH1). For the recycled gas, 1% was purged in order to
avoid accumulation of by-products and inert components [14]. Such components were however not
included in the process model. The remaining recycled gas was recompressed to 51.0 bar in COMP6
and mixed with the fresh feed.
The liquid separated in FLASH1 consisted of methanol and water at a molar ratio of approximately
one, together with a small fraction of dissolved gases. The pressure of this stream was reduced to
1.2 bar, and the majority of the dissolved gases were separated and purged in FLASH2. The liquid
stream was heated to 81.0 ◦C in HX3 and fed to the distillation column (DIST1) operated at 1.2 bar.
The column consisted of 30 ideal equilibrium stages, and the reﬂux ratio equaled 1.1. The top product,
consisting mainly of methanol and dissolved CO2, was cooled to 35.0 ◦C in HX4, and most of the CO2
was separated in FLASH3. The ﬁnal purity of the methanol product was 99.3 wt%. Water (99.0 wt%)
was removed from the bottom of the distillation column.
2.5.3. Liquid-Phase Methanol Synthesis
The liquid-phase methanol synthesis process was based on the combination of a conventional
Cu/ZnO catalyst and alcohol as a catalytic solvent.
In the presence of the alcoholic solvent,
the reaction proceeded through the formate ester of the corresponding alcohol as an intermediate [25].
This reaction mechanism allowed methanol synthesis at lower reaction temperatures compared to the
gas-phase process.
The ﬂowsheet of the liquid-phase methanol synthesis process using 1-butanol solvent is presented
in Figure 3. The liquid-phase process was also modelled with 2-butanol using identical process design.
In the following description, the stream conditions and compositions of the 1-butanol process are
used as examples. The major diﬀerences between the two solvents were found in the design and
performance of the separation stage, as summarized in Table 3 at the end of this section.

The unreacted gases together with product and solvent vapors were removed from the reactor, 
while the liquid level was maintained by the solvent recycled. The heat from the gas/vapor outlet 
(Stream 14) was used to preheat the reactor feed in HX1. The heat available in the outlet stream was 
utilized to pre-heat the distillation feed (HX3), to pre-heat the solvent recycle (HX4), and in the 
reboiler of the second distillation column (DIST2). The product stream was then further cooled to 35 
°C in HX5, and the majority of the unreacted gases were then separated from the condensed solvent 
and products in FLASH1. In SPLIT1, 1% of the recycled gases was purged and the remainder 
recompressed to 52.0 bar (COMP6) and mixed with the fresh feed gases.  
The condensed liquid stream leaving FLASH1 was pre-heated in HX3; the pressure was reduced 
to 1.4 bar, and the stream entered the first distillation column (DIST1) at 75.4 °C. Methanol and water 
were removed as the top product. A fraction of the solvent was also distilled due to the alcohol-water 
azeotrope. The majority of the solvent was removed from the bottom stage and recycled.  
The vapor product from DIST1 was fed to the second distillation column (DIST2), operated at 
1.2 bar. Methanol was removed from the top of the column, while water and the remaining solvent 
were removed from the bottom. The methanol stream was cooled to 35.0 °C in the exchanger HX6, 
and most of the dissolved CO2 remaining was removed in FLASH3. The purity of the methanol 
product was 99.2% by weight. The mixture of water and solvent from the bottom stage was fed to a 
decanter at 95.8 °C and 1.2 bar. In the decanter, the heterogeneous alcohol-water azeotrope was split 
into a removed water-rich (89% by mass) waste stream and a solvent-rich (81% 1-butanol) recycled 
stream (2-butanol process: 90% water and 82% 2-butanol, respectively). The recycled gas was mixed 
with the solvent removed in DIST1, resulting in a final composition of 96 wt% 1-butanol and 4 wt% 
water in the solvent recycled. One percent of the solvent recycled was purged, and the stream was 
cooled in HX7 for vapor condensation. The recycled gas was then mixed with the solvent make-up, 
and the pressure of the mixed stream was then increased to the reactor pressure by the solvent pump 
(PUMP1). The solvent was pre-heated to 136.7 °C in HX4 and finally heated to 180 °C in HX8.

Identical to the gas-phase process, 533.2 kg/h of hydrogen and 3881.7 kg/h CO2 were fed to the
liquid-phase process. The hydrogen feed was compressed to 52.0 bar in a single stage (COMP5), and the
CO2 feed was compressed to 52.0 bar in four stages (COMP1–4) with intercooling (COOLER1–3).
The pressure ratio of Stages 1–3 equaled 3.0, while the ﬁnal stage was speciﬁed to the outlet pressure of
52.0 bar. The feed gases were mixed with the recycled gas (MIX1), and the mixed feed was preheated
to 138.1 ◦C by heat exchange with the reactor vapor outlet (HX1). The feed was further heated to
180.0 ◦C in the heater HX2. The feed gas was fed to the isothermal bubble column reactor operated at

180.0 ◦C and 50.0 bar. Details on the design and modelling of the liquid-phase reactor are discussed in
Section 2.1.
The unreacted gases together with product and solvent vapors were removed from the reactor,
while the liquid level was maintained by the solvent recycled. The heat from the gas/vapor outlet
(Stream 14) was used to preheat the reactor feed in HX1. The heat available in the outlet stream was
utilized to pre-heat the distillation feed (HX3), to pre-heat the solvent recycle (HX4), and in the reboiler
of the second distillation column (DIST2). The product stream was then further cooled to 35 ◦C in HX5,
and the majority of the unreacted gases were then separated from the condensed solvent and products
in FLASH1. In SPLIT1, 1% of the recycled gases was purged and the remainder recompressed to 52.0
bar (COMP6) and mixed with the fresh feed gases.
The condensed liquid stream leaving FLASH1 was pre-heated in HX3; the pressure was reduced
to 1.4 bar, and the stream entered the ﬁrst distillation column (DIST1) at 75.4 ◦C. Methanol and water
were removed as the top product. A fraction of the solvent was also distilled due to the alcohol-water
azeotrope. The majority of the solvent was removed from the bottom stage and recycled.
The vapor product from DIST1 was fed to the second distillation column (DIST2), operated at 1.2
bar. Methanol was removed from the top of the column, while water and the remaining solvent were
removed from the bottom. The methanol stream was cooled to 35.0 ◦C in the exchanger HX6, and most
of the dissolved CO2 remaining was removed in FLASH3. The purity of the methanol product was
99.2% by weight. The mixture of water and solvent from the bottom stage was fed to a decanter
at 95.8 ◦C and 1.2 bar. In the decanter, the heterogeneous alcohol-water azeotrope was split into a
removed water-rich (89% by mass) waste stream and a solvent-rich (81% 1-butanol) recycled stream
(2-butanol process: 90% water and 82% 2-butanol, respectively). The recycled gas was mixed with the
solvent removed in DIST1, resulting in a ﬁnal composition of 96 wt% 1-butanol and 4 wt% water in
the solvent recycled. One percent of the solvent recycled was purged, and the stream was cooled in
HX7 for vapor condensation. The recycled gas was then mixed with the solvent make-up, and the
pressure of the mixed stream was then increased to the reactor pressure by the solvent pump (PUMP1).
The solvent was pre-heated to 136.7 ◦C in HX4 and ﬁnally heated to 180 ◦C in HX8.
Details of the speciﬁcations and performance of the distillation columns in the gas-phase and
liquid-phase processes are given in Table 3.
The data allowed us to compare the simplicity of
separating methanol from each product-solvent mixture. In the gas-phase process, only a single
column with low energy input was required to separate methanol from the water by-product. In the
liquid-phase processes, two columns were necessary to separate both methanol and water from the
solvent. In 2-butanol, this separation was signiﬁcantly capital and energy intensive due to the similar
volatility of the components (2-butanol has a boiling point of approximately 99 ◦C). The separation was
less costly with 1-butanol, which has a boiling point of 117.7 ◦C. The formation of azeotropes between
water and the solvent was also a complicating factor in the separation processes. The azeotropic
mixtures with water consisted of 40% of 2-butanol (at 87.2 ◦C) and 25% of 1-butanol (92.5 ◦C) on a
molar basis [48].
The energy consumed in distillation could be reduced by more rigorous heat integration in the
processes. In all of the processes, the heat from the hot reactor outlet was exchanged to preheat the
distillation feed, based on the implementation of the gas-phase process by Van-Dal and Bouallou [14].
In the liquid-phase processes, alternative heat integration schemes could lead to energy savings,
but this was not explored in detail in the present work.
3. Results and Discussion
The various methanol synthesis processes were compared in terms of the mass balances, energy
and electricity consumption, and the overall methanol production cost. The performance of the reactor
in the gas-phase and liquid-phase processes was also compared. Additional results with more details
are included in the Supplementary Material, as referenced in the text.

3.1. Reactor Sizing and Performance
Figure 4 presents the temperature and composition proﬁle of the adiabatic reactor in the gas-phase
process. The composition is given in terms of the mole fractions of CO2, CO, and methanol. The mole
fraction of water over the reactor length was essentially identical to that of methanol. The reactions
modelled here, i.e., CO2 hydrogenation to methanol (Equation (1)) and the reverse-water gas shift
(RWGS, Equation (3)), reached equilibrium after one meter of reactor length. Due to the low contribution
of the reactor capital cost to the overall production cost (Section 3.4), this was considered satisfactory,
and further reactor optimization was omitted. At this point, the peak temperature inside the reactor
(274.5 ◦C) was reached, and 20.3% of the CO2 entering the reactor was converted. Thus, a signiﬁcant
amount of unreacted gases was recycled, and the recycle ratio equaled 5.3 in the reactor loop. CO2 was
converted to methanol at a selectivity of 96.1%. The mole fraction of CO remained low throughout the
reactor length, and the constant concentration of CO after approximately 0.5 m corresponded to the
equilibrium level of the RWGS.

Figure 4. Reactor temperature and composition profile in the gas-phase CO2 hydrogenation to 
methanol process. Adiabatic reactor, inlet temperature 215.0 °C, and pressure 52.0 bar. 
The lack of a detailed kinetic model for the alcohol-promoted process prevented detailed reactor 
modelling in the liquid-phase processes. Therefore, the reactor was approximated as an ideal 
continually-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) with full equilibrium conversion of the CO2 hydrogenation 
to methanol and RWGS reactions. This method gave a “best-case scenario” view of this process, as 
the reaction kinetics was ignored.  
In the 1-butanol process, approximately 2.7 t/h of methanol was produced in the reactor based 
on the reactor mass balance. Based on the specific methanol formation rate of 0.17 kg/(l h), the slurry 
(liquid + catalyst) volume required was thus 15.8 m3. At a 5% catalyst volume fraction, the volume of 
the catalyst was 0.8 m3. At a catalyst density of 1775 kg/m3 [14], the mass of the catalyst was 1.4 t. 
Assuming a 25 vol% provision for gas/vapor space, the total reactor volume was 17.8 m3. To 
determine the aspect ratio, a superficial gas velocity of 0.1 m/s [49] was assumed, resulting in a reactor 
diameter of 1.7 m and a height of 8.8 m. The average residence time of the gas in the reactor was 67 s 
and the hourly space velocity per catalyst weight was 576.3 L/kg h and per slurry volume 51.1 L/h. 
The same reactor sizing was assumed for the 2-butanol process.  
Table 4 presents the composition of the inlet and outlet streams to the reactor in the 1-butanol 
process. A similar distribution of reactants and products in the liquid and gas/vapor phases was 
found in other solvents. The gas-phase inlet consisted of the feed gas mixture, and the recycled and 
make-up solvent constituted the liquid phase inlet. The gas/vapor outlet consisted of the product and 
solvent vapors together with unreacted gases.

The lower reaction temperature (180.0 ◦C) compared to the gas-phase process led to a relatively
higher CO2 conversion. The per-pass conversion was 81% with 1-butanol and 79% with 2-butanol as
the solvent. The phase distribution of the reactants and the products appeared to have a favorable
eﬀect on the conversion, as the single-phase equilibrium conversion was in the region of 40% at the
present reaction conditions [10]. The evaporation of methanol and water from the liquid phase seemed
to drive the conversion of the reactants. The slightly diﬀerent phase distribution due to the higher
volatility of 2-butanol was also suggested to lead to the diﬀerent conversion value in the 2-butanol and
1-butanol processes.
3.2. Mass and Energy Balances
Table 5 gives a summary of the mass balances of the alternative methanol synthesis processes.
More detailed balances with the individual inlet and outlet streams can be found in Tables S4–S6 in the
Supplementary Material. The overall methanol yield was calculated as the mass ﬂow of methanol in the
product stream divided by the stoichiometric methanol output based on the CO2 and hydrogen inlet.
The yield was decreased by losses of reactants or methanol from the process. In Table 5, the methanol
yield is 81% in the gas-phase process, 82% in the 2-butanol process, and 88% in the 1-butanol process.
Table 5. Mass balance of the alternative methanol synthesis processes. Methanol yield is the ratio
of the mass ﬂow of methanol product to the mass ﬂow corresponding to 100% yield based on the
stoichiometric CO2 and hydrogen inlets. Fractional solvent loss is calculated as the ratio of solvent ﬂow
removed from the process to the solvent ﬂow (make-up + recycle) fed to the reactor.

Losses of CO2, hydrogen, and methanol are also seen in Table 5. Components were lost with
the purge and waste streams removed from the processes. In the gas-phase process, these streams
consisted of the purge from the gas recycle, the bottoms from the distillation column, and the purged
gases from the separators FLASH2 and FLASH3 (see the ﬂowsheet in Figure 2). The majority of the
methanol loss occurred in the purge from FLASH2. Due to the large amount of unreacted CO2 and the
hydrogen present in the recycle stream, the loss of reactants with the purge was signiﬁcantly higher
compared to the liquid-phase processes, leading to the lower overall methanol yield.
In the liquid-phase processes, components were lost with the gas and solvent recycle purges,
the water-rich stream from the decanter, and also the purge stream from FLASH3 (Figure 3). The purge
from FLASH3 constituted most of the methanol and gas losses, while the solvent was mainly lost from
the decanter. This loss is explained by the alcohol-water azeotrope. A signiﬁcant amount was also lost
with the liquid purge stream, which could only be minimized based on detailed information on the
formation and accumulation of by-products. Overall, the fraction of solvent lost was 2% for 2-butanol
and 3% for 1-butanol. However, the absolute amount of solvent lost was higher in the 2-butanol
process, as a larger amount of solvent was circulated in order to maintain the liquid/gas volume ratio
in the reactor.
The presence of a large quantity of solvent in the product streams signiﬁcantly increased the
distillation energy requirement in the liquid phase process, especially as a second column was required.
For each process, the overall heat and electricity consumption per ton of methanol produced are
presented in Table 6. It should be noted that the electricity required in the electrolysis unit was included
in the cost of hydrogen, and hence was not included here. Electricity consumption in Table 6 only
includes that used in compression of the gaseous feed and recycle streams and in pumping the recycled
solvent in the liquid-phase processes. The waste heat generated by combustion of the process purge
and waste streams was also included in the energy balance. The hot utility requirement corresponded
to the amount of external heat required after integration of the waste heat.

The gas-phase process did not require hot utility as the reaction heat was suﬃcient to supply
all process heating. Due to the combustion of purge streams for waste heat, the process produced
a net heat output of 2.7 MW. In contrast, the liquid-phase process required external heat due to the
more energy-intensive separation stage. In addition, less heat was available from the reactor due
to the energy consumed in solvent evaporation, which is a downside to the eﬃcient heat control
provided by the liquid. Due to the less energy-intensive distillation stage, the use of the less volatile
solvent 1-butanol was found to improve the energy eﬃciency of the liquid-phase process compared to
2-butanol signiﬁcantly. The net heating duty in the 1-butanol process was 41% and the cooling duty
37% lower compared to the 2-butanol process. The utilization of waste heat signiﬁcantly reduced the
amount of external hot utility required: waste heat provided 38% of the process heat in each of the
liquid-phase processes.
The electricity consumption of the liquid-phase processes was slightly higher compared to the
gas-phase process. The increased per-pass conversion in the liquid-phase processes led to lower ﬂow
rate of the gas recycle, resulting in a reduction in electricity consumption by the recycle compressor.
These reductions were, however, oﬀset by the requirement of the solvent recycle pump in the liquid
Processes 2019, 7, 405

phase processes. Energy requirements of the individual process equipment can be found in Table S9 in
the Supplementary Material.
3.3. Environmental Analysis
The CO2 and water balances of the alternative processes are presented in Table 7. A negative
CO2 balance signiﬁes that the amount of CO2 consumed in methanol synthesis was higher than the
sum of the direct and indirect CO2 emissions of the process. The lowest net emissions (−3046 kg/h)
were found with the gas-phase process, in which all process heat was supplied by the exothermic
reaction and fuel combustion was not required. In the liquid-phase process, generation of process heat
lead to signiﬁcant CO2 emissions. In the 1-butanol process, the net emission was −1239 kg/h, or 59%
higher compared to the gas-phase process. In the 2-butanol process, the net emission was positive
(216 kg/h), as the amount of CO2 emitted in heat generation was signiﬁcantly higher compared to the
1-butanol process. In each process, waste heat generation led to additional emissions. However, in the
liquid-phase processes, these emissions were oﬀset by the reduced amount of natural gas burned for
process heating.

Although large amounts of cooling water were required in the processes, the environmental
impact of the cooling water input was not particularly signiﬁcant, assuming that the used water (at
25 ◦C) can be released without treatment and that a suﬃcient amount of water is readily available.
Waste water treatment was simpliﬁed by minimizing the amount of mixed water/alcohol waste and
by minimizing the alcohol content in the waste stream. The gas-phase process appeared the most
favorable in terms of waste water treatment as the amount of waste produced was the lowest and the
alcohol content (methanol) was only 1.1%. The waste water ﬂow rate and alcohol content were similar
in both the 2-butanol and 1-butanol processes.
As grid electricity was assumed to be used in the methanol synthesis processes, the environmental
impact of electricity consumption was dependent on the sources of electricity supporting the grid at
the particular location and time. The electricity consumption of the processes is compared in Table 6,
and discussed in Section 3.2. The electricity consumption did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer between the
alternative processes. At the CO2 intensity of 170 g CO2/kWh, the corresponding CO2 emissions were
106 kg/h, 116 kg/h, and 106 kg/h for the gas-phase, 1-butanol, and 2-butanol processes, respectively.
These emissions were not signiﬁcant for the overall CO2 balance, as seen in Table 7.
3.4. Methanol Production Cost and Net Present Value
The overall methanol production cost consisted of the variable and ﬁxed operating costs and
the annualized capital investment. A comparison of the production costs of the diﬀerent processes
is presented in Figure 5, while a detailed overview of the capital and operating costs is given in
Processes 2019, 7, 405

the Supplementary Material (Tables S10 and S11). The gas-phase process was found to be the most
competitive with a methanol production cost of 963 €/t. The overall production costs were higher
with the liquid-phase processes due to the energy-intensive separation stage and the added cost of
solvent make-up. The cost of 1205 €/t with the 1-butanol process was 25% higher compared to the

The net present value (NPV) of each process over the assumed plant lifetime of 20 years is
presented in Figure 5. The NPV was negative for all of the processes; thus, no process was ﬁnancially
feasible under the presented conditions and assumptions. In accordance with the lowest methanol
production cost, the highest NPV (−87.0 M€) was found with the gas-phase process, whereas the NPV
was −127.7 M€ for the 1-butanol process and −145 M€ for the 2-butanol process.
Figure 6 presents the contribution of individual variable cost components in the gas-phase and
liquid phase processes. In all three processes, hydrogen was the main cost component, constituting
97%, 59%, and 68% of the variable costs, and 73%, 48%, and 54% of the total methanol production cost
in the gas-phase, 2-butanol, and 1-butanol processes, respectively. In the gas-phase process, the cost of
CO2 was the second largest variable cost, while in the liquid-phase processes, the cost of utility steam
was more signiﬁcant due to the increased distillation energy requirement compared to the gas-phase
process. The cost of heating in the 1-butanol process corresponded to 174 €/t MeOH, and if the heat
requirement could be eliminated by process or site heat integration, the resulting methanol production
cost would equal 1031 €/t. As the gas-phase process produced an output of heat that was available
for steam generation, the variable costs were decreased by the steam credit. The steam credit also
oﬀset the electricity and cold utility costs of the process. In the 1-butanol process, the cost of solvent
make-up constituted 5% of the variable costs and 4% of the overall cost. In the 2-butanol process,
solvent make-up corresponded to 6% of the variable costs and 5% of the overall cost.
Compressors constituted the largest fraction of installed equipment costs, as seen in Figure 7.
The total capital investment, calculated from the installed equipment costs by the factorial method,
was lowest in the gas-phase process at 10.5 M€. The 2-butanol and 1-butanol processes required a
capital investment of 12.9 M€ and 11.6 M€, respectively. The share of the separation section (ﬂash
vessels and distillation columns) was larger in the liquid-phase process compared to the gas-phase
process. The higher capital costs of the 2-butanol process compared to the 1-butanol process were
explained by the more costly distillation columns.

As expected from Figure 6, the cost of hydrogen was found to have the highest impact on the
overall cost. In the gas-phase process, the overall production cost was 612 €/t at a hydrogen cost 50% of
the base value, corresponding to a hydrogen cost of 1500 €/t. In the 1-butanol process, the production
cost was 878 €/t at the hydrogen cost of 1500 €/t. The cost of hydrogen generated by water electrolysis
was expected to decrease with the development of electrolyzer technology and the decreasing cost of
renewable electricity. The decline in the cost of photovoltaic electricity has been particularly quick [50],
potentially providing a more competitive route to renewable methanol compared to wind electricity in
the near future. At the same time, the electrolyzer capital costs are expected to decrease, particularly in
the case of more advanced proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide (SOEC) electrolyzers [51].
Clearly, a signiﬁcant reduction in the hydrogen cost would be required to make these processes
competitive at present methanol prices. The hydrogen cost required to reach a methanol cost of 400 €/t
was approximately 600 €/t for the gas-phase process. For the 1-butanol process, this threshold was not
reached even at zero hydrogen cost.
Due to the high contribution of operating costs to the overall production cost, the economics of
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol were not particularly sensitive to the capital investment. The economic
impact of oxygen sales was apparent. If oxygen was not sold at all, the methanol production cost
increased to 1028 €/t in the gas-phase process and 1266 €/t in the 1-pentanol process. The impact of
oxygen sales was found to be higher than that of the CO2 cost. Similar to the hydrogen cost, the cost of
CO2 capture is expected to decrease with technological development. However, the economics of the
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process do not seem to be heavily aﬀected by these developments.
3.6. Summary
The beneﬁts and challenges of the liquid-phase CO2 hydrogenation to methanol process compared
to the gas-phase process are qualitatively summarized in Table 8. The advantage of the liquid-phase
process was the increased per pass conversion due to the lower reaction temperature and the apparent
favorable distribution of products between the gas and liquid phases in the reactor. At the same
reaction pressure of 50 bar, the per pass CO2 conversion was increased from 20% in the gas-phase
process to 79% in the 2-butanol process and 81% in the 1-butanol phase process. The conversion in
the liquid-phase processes was higher than the single-phase equilibrium conversion at the reaction
conditions. This is presumably due to the beneﬁcial phase equilibrium, i.e., the evaporation of products
from the reacting liquid phase. However, uncertainties in the prediction of the phase distribution
were present due to a lack of experimental data at the reaction conditions. In addition, whereas the
gas-phase reaction could be modelled in detail using an available kinetic model, the liquid-phase
reactions were modelled as equilibrium reactions without considering the reaction kinetics. In practice,
the reaction rates in the liquid-phase process should be similar in magnitude to the gas-phase process
in order to avoid excessively large reactor volumes.
In the gas-phase process, large amounts of gases are recycled in the reactor loop and purged
from the process. As a result, the overall methanol yield was only 81%. In the liquid-phase processes,
the overall methanol yield was 82% with 2-butanol and 88% with 1-butanol. However, the introduction
of the solvent led to a more complicated overall process due to the complex phase equilibrium
and mutual solubility of the reactants, products, and solvent, as well as increased demands on the
separation stage. The large amounts of solvent present led to increased capital and energy intensity of
the separation stage. The diﬀerence was manifested in the overall energy balance of the gas-phase
and liquid-phase processes. While the gas-phase process produced a net heat output, the liquid phase
processes required a signiﬁcant net heat input, together with increased cooling duties. However, the
energy consumption of the liquid-phase processes could be improved by more rigorous heat integration.
The diﬀerent alcohols used as solvents had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the energy consumption and
overall methanol production cost. Compared to 2-butanol, whose boiling point is similar to that
of water, the heat eﬃciency of the process was signiﬁcantly improved by using 1-butanol, which
possesses a higher boiling point. Ideally, even higher boiling point solvents would be used to simplify
Processes 2019, 7, 405
19 of 24
the separation, potentially allowing selective evaporation of methanol and water from the reactor.
However, the solvent should also be suﬃciently active in the alcohol-promoted reaction to obtain
reasonable reaction rates at low reaction temperatures. Development of increasingly active catalyst
systems could allow even lower reaction temperatures, further increasing the equilibrium conversion.
For example, Chen et al. [52] demonstrated a heterogeneous cascade catalytic system for liquid-phase
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at 135 ◦C, with the reaction promoted by ethanol. The beneﬁcial
eﬀect of the phase distribution in the liquid-phase reactor to the equilibrium conversion level, found in
the present process modelling work, should also be experimentally veriﬁed and further investigated.
Another approach to increase the equilibrium conversion and reaction rate could be provided by the
adsorption of water from the reaction mixture [53] or by in situ condensation of water and methanol [54].

Additional costs to the liquid-phase process were caused by the loss of solvent. Two percent of
2-butanol and 3% of 1-butanol and 2-butanol entering the reactor were lost in downstream processing
in the present processes. The loss was explained by the alcohol forming azeotropic mixtures with water.
Without the introduction of an additional, complicated separation sequence to break the azeotropes,
a fraction of the solvent was necessarily lost with the waste water removed from the process.
Environmental analysis was performed in terms of the CO2 and water balances and the electricity
consumption of the studied processes. The net CO2 balance of the gas-phase and 1-butanol processes
was found to be negative, i.e., the processes consumed more CO2 than was released. However, the CO2
balance was positive for the 2-butanol processes. The lowest net CO2 emission, −3.0 t/h, was found
with the gas-phase process, which did not require fuel combustion for heat generation. The hot
utility requirement of the liquid-phase processes led to increased emissions. The net emission was
−1.2 t/h with the 1-butanol process and 216 t/h with the 2-butanol process. The impact of the CO2
emitted in electricity generation was insigniﬁcant as regards the process CO2 balances. The gas-phase
process produced the lowest ﬂow rate of waste water (1371 kg/h), with a methanol content of 1.11 wt%.
The 2-butanol process produced 1573 kg/h, and the 1-butanol process produced 1644 kg/h of waste
water, both streams with an alcohol content of 9 wt%.
In terms of overall methanol production costs, the gas-phase process appeared more competitive
than the liquid-phase processes, having a production cost of 963 €/t. This value appears to be consistent
with previous studies. For example, Atsonios et al. [18], Rivera-Tinoco et al. [17], and Tremel et al. [23]
estimated costs between 800 and 1000 €/t at production scales comparable to the present study.
Pérez-Fortes et al. [16] estimated a break-even methanol price of 724 €/t for large industrial-scale
production at a hydrogen cost of 3090 €/t (compared to 3000 €/t in the present study). However,
Processes 2019, 7, 405

signiﬁcantly lower costs have been reported by other authors [15,32,55,56]. For instance, Anicic
et al. [15] found the cost of methanol produced from captured CO2 and hydrogen from electrolysis
(below 400 €/t) to be competitive with fossil fuel-based methanol production. It appears that this
variation was a result of the diﬀerent assumptions and methods employed in the analyses.
In the liquid-phase process, the production cost was 1205 €/t with 1-butanol and 1349 €/t with
2-butanol. The costs were 25% and 40% higher compared to the gas-phase process. The higher
costs compared to the gas-phase process were explained by the more complex and energy-intensive
separation stage and the added cost of the solvent make-up. The variation in the production cost for
diﬀerent liquid solvents was explained by the diﬀerent capital costs and especially the energy costs of
the distillation stage.
In all the processes considered here, the overall production cost was dominated by variable
operating costs, especially the cost of hydrogen (73%, 48%, and 54% of the total production cost in
the gas-phase, 2-butanol, and 1-butanol processes, respectively). As a result, the overall methanol
production cost was highly sensitive to the cost of hydrogen. In the gas-phase process, a hydrogen cost
of 600 €/t would be required to lower the methanol production cost to 400 €/t, representing the present
methanol price. The liquid-phase processes did not meet this threshold value even at zero hydrogen
cost. The heating costs in the 1-butanol process corresponded to 174 €/t MeOH. At present, none of
the processes appeared economically feasible, with the 20-year net present values of −87 M€ for the
gas-phase process, −128 M€ for the 1-butanol process, and −145 M€ for the 2-butanol process.
4. Conclusions
The feasibility of alternative CO2 hydrogenation to methanol processes was compared by means
of ﬂowsheet modelling and economic analysis. The processes compared included a conventional
gas-phase process and a liquid-phase process with 2-butanol and 1-butanol as alternative solvents.
The potential beneﬁt of the liquid-phase processes was that lower reaction temperatures were allowed
by the co-catalytic activity of the alcoholic solvent. At the same reaction pressure of 50 bar, the per pass
conversion of CO2 in the reactor was increased from 20% in the gas-phase process to approximately
80% in the liquid-phase processes. The conversion in the liquid-phase processes was higher than the
single-phase equilibrium conversion at the reaction conditions, apparently due to the evaporation of
reaction products from the reacting liquid phase. As a result of the decreased amount of recycled gases,
the overall conversion of CO2 to methanol of 81% in the gas-phase process was increased to 82% and
88% in the 2-butanol and 1-butanol processes, respectively.
The beneﬁts of the increased equilibrium conversion were found to be limited to slightly lower
capital and operating costs in the reactor loop. However, the presence of large quantities of solvent
in the reactor eﬄuent led to a capital- and energy-intensive separation stage, which required two
distillation columns compared to one in the gas-phase process. In addition, the formation of azeotropes
between the alcohols and the water by-product complicated the separation and led to losses of solvent.
Due to the increased energy consumption and the cost of solvent make-up, the methanol production
cost of the most competitive liquid-phase process (1-butanol) was 1205 €/t, compared to the production
cost of 963 €/t for the gas-phase process. The cost of heating in the 1-butanol process corresponded
to 174 €/t MeOH, and if the heat requirement could be eliminated by process or site heat integration,
the resulting methanol production cost would equal 1031 €/t.
None of the processes, in gas or liquid phases, were competitive at the present methanol price
of approximately 400 €/t. The 20-year net present values of the gas-phase process and the 1-butanol
and 2-butanol processes were estimated at −87 M€, −128 M€, and −145 M€, respectively. Hydrogen
constituted the largest fraction of the overall cost in all processes, at 73%, 48%, and 54% in the above
processes, respectively. In terms of CO2 emissions, the most favorable CO2 balance was found with the
gas-phase process, with a net consumption of 3.0 t/h of CO2. The 1-butanol process also showed a
negative CO2 balance, with a net CO2 consumption of 1.2 t/h. Due to the higher amount of utility heat
required, the 2-butanol process showed positive net emission of 0.2 t/h of CO2. The water balance of
Processes 2019, 7, 405
21 of 24
the gas-phase was also the most favorable, with the smallest amount of waste water released at the
lowest alcohol content. The amount of and composition of waste water produced was similar in each
of the liquid-phase processes.
To conclude, a feasible preliminary process design for the liquid-phase methanol synthesis process
was developed. However, further optimization and improved heat integration are required to improve
the process economics. Due to the greater complexity and less favorable energy balance of the
liquid-phase process, the estimated methanol production cost was found to be 25% and 40% higher
with the 1-butanol and 2-butanol processes compared to the baseline gas-phase process. It should be
noted that signiﬁcant assumptions and simpliﬁcations were made in modelling of the liquid-phase
processes. In particular, reaction kinetics were not considered, and the equilibrium reactor model used
presented a “best-case scenario” of the reactor performance. More detailed experimental information
on reaction kinetics, yields, and thermodynamics is required to allow more in-depth modelling of the
liquid-phase reaction system.
Regardless of these limitations, it is concluded that the liquid-phase CO2 hydrogenation to
methanol process shows potential, and the present ﬁndings provide valuable information for further
development.
The main advantage of the alcohol-promoted liquid-phase process is the higher
equilibrium conversion allowed by operation at lower temperatures, and future development should
aim to further increase the conversion levels to approach ideally full single-pass conversion. Possibilities
include increasingly active catalyst/solvent systems allowing even lower reaction temperatures, removal
of water from the reactor by means of adsorption, or in situ condensation of water and methanol from
a gaseous reaction mixture. The apparent beneﬁcial eﬀect of the phase distribution in the liquid-phase
reactor should also be investigated further, and both the co-catalytic eﬀect and ease of separation
should be considered in the selection of alcoholic solvents. More advanced reactor designs (e.g.,
reactive distillation) and separation methods (e.g., dividing wall columns) should also be considered,
together with energy provision by heat pumps to decrease the cost and CO2 intensity of the processes.
