Abstract: This study aims to investigate, from a technical and an environmental perspective, various
alternatives for acetic acid concentration for maximizing acetic acid production, its purity, and in the
meantime, minimizing the energy usage and the environmental impact. Liquid–liquid extraction
followed by azeotropic distillation using different solvents such as: (i) ethyl acetate, (ii) isopropyl
acetate, and (iii) a mixture containing isopropyl acetate and isopropanol were first explored, using
process flow modeling software. The three cases were compared considering various technical key
performance indicators (i.e., acetic acid flow-rate, acetic acid purity, acetic acid recovery, power con-
sumption, thermal energy used, and number of equipment units involved) leading to the conclusion
that the usage of the isopropyl acetate—isopropanol mixture leads to better technical results. The
isopropanol-isopropyl acetate mixture was furthermore investigated in other two cases where process
intensification methods, based on thermally coupled respectively the double-effect distillation process,
are proposed. The highest quantity of pure acetic acid (e.g., 136 kmol/h) and the highest recovery
rate (e.g., 97.74%) were obtained using the double-effect method. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assess-
ment, involving ReCiPe method, was used to calculate and compare various environmental impact
indicators (i.e., climate change, freshwater toxicity potential, human toxicity, etc.). Several steam
sources (i.e., hard coal, heavy fuel oil, light fuel oil, natural gas, and biomass) were considered in the
environmental evaluation. The results of the life cycle assessment show a reduction, by almost half, in
all the environmental impact indicators when the double effect method is compared to the thermally
coupled process. The usage of biomass for steam generation lead to lower impacts compared to steam
generation using fossil fuels (i.e., hard coal, heavy fuel oil, light fuel oil, natural gas).
Keywords: acetic acid concentration; process intensiﬁcation; azeotropic distillation; thermally cou-

1. Introduction
Acetic acid, also called ethanoic acid, is an organic compound with the chemical
formula CH3COOH used in several domains such as chemical, pharmaceutical, polymer,
paint, textile and food industries [1].
Around 15 million tons of acetic acid was used in the past year all over the world. It is
expected that in the following years the demand will grow up to 18 million tons and there
on to increase with 5% every year due to the enlarging range of utilization in the industrial
domain. The biggest quantity of this liquid is produced in the Asia-Paciﬁc region, where
it is also mostly consumed [2]. The demand for the acetic acid in 2020 was 11.9 tons and
during the forecasted period, it is projected to grow with 4.8% in the following years [3]. At
the beginning of 2022, it has been noticed that the Asia Paciﬁc area is the biggest producer
and consumer of this substance, and the vinyl acetate monomer is using one-third of the
total acetic acid obtained. In order to meet the growing request of the market for this
product, new plants will be built in China. It is expected that the North American and
European markets will decrease their demand since more production lines will be replaced

with those from Asia [4]. The biggest producers of this substance are China, where 55% of
the total acetic acid is produced and the USA where 17% is produced [4], and the producers
are represented by companies such as British Petroleum, Lyondell Basell, and Eastman and
they ship it all over the globe [3]. The main consumers are located in China, the USA, Japan,
Europe, and the Asia Paciﬁc region with the main representatives as Jiangsu Sopo Co.Ltd.,
Shanghai Wujing Chemical, Indian Oil Corporation, DuPont. Lyondell Basel is involved
in the production of polymers and plastics since it produces high amounts of household
objects, construction materials, and car accessories [3].
Due to its broad spectrum of applications, acetic acid is a vastly used substance in the
food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industry as it can be seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Acetic acid conversion routes in the industry [5,6]. 
In countries such as China, the United States, Japan, and European countries, the 
major part of this substance is transformed into polymers obtained from vinyl acetate 
monomer which is used for synthetizing coatings, dyes, or adhesives [5,6]. Ethanoic acid 
is also used in synthesis plants in order to obtain polymers, dyes, paints, disinfectants, 
processing fibers, or textiles [5]. A share of 18% of the total quantity of acetic acid is 
transformed into acetic anhydride, 17% of the acid is used for obtaining terephthalate 
acid, which is further used for obtaining polyethylene terephthalate, resins, or textile fi-
bers [1]. When mixing acetic acid with olefins, acetate esters can be easily obtained and 
those can be used for obtaining soaps, lubricants, and adhesive paste. Acetate ester is 
used as a solvent for obtaining inks, coatings for ceramics and paints [5]. 
Acetic acid can be obtained using various industrial methods and various 
raw-materials such as synthesis gas, oil, and algae. The synthetic routes have been ex-
plored on a large scale since 1913 by the BASF Company, later by Monsanto, Celanese, 
and the Showa Denko companies [2,7]. The main methods of obtaining acetic acid are: 
methanol carbonylation, acetaldehyde oxidation, ethylene oxidation, fermentation (i.e., 
anaerobic, aerobic), and lignocellulosic matter distillation, being obtained in the biomass 
pretreatment phase [8]. These methods are schematically represented in Figure 2 [5].

Figure 2. The main methods for obtaining acetic acid [5]. 
Acetic acid being such an indispensable substance for the industry, the concentra-
tion and separation of this substance from its aqueous solution has been highly studied. 
Since the global industry is trying to make its way to a more sustainable and green future, 
the eco-friendly approaches are taken into consideration. Unfortunately, one of the main 
problems of obtaining acetic acid via the environmental-friendly methods is the fact that 
the final product is obtained in a diluted solution and it must be concentrated in order to 
be further processed [2]. The fact that the acetic acid has low volatility compared to the 
water saturated solution is one of the main problems of the concentration process [2]. 
Conventional distillation of acetic acid and water is an energy intensive process which is 
not used in practical applications due to the fact that acetic acid is the heavy component 
forcing large quantities of water to be condensed overhead. The conventional distillation 
of acetic acid and water requires also high boil-up ratios for high acetic acid purity [9]. As 
mentioned by Javed and co-authors, distillation has relatively low thermodynamic effi-
ciency, so it is a prime target for process intensification studies. A small improvement in 
the thermodynamic efficiency of distillation columns can make a large difference in the 
overall process efficiency and profitability [10]. 
In the above-mentioned context, several methods have been proposed and devel-
oped to separate the main product using extractive distillation process [11], a salt-effect 
distillation process [12], or extraction of the acetic acid using the azeotropic distillation 
method [2]. 
The liquid–liquid extraction plays an important role in the separation methods since 
it implies low process costs. The key aspect of this extraction is the equilibrium relation-
ship between the components; these systems need to be very well studied before choos-
ing a suitable extraction component. Compared to the single solvent method, it has been 
noticed that a synergetic relationship is formed when a dual solvent is used and the 
process has better results than the classical method. The process of separating acetic acid 
and water from solution by the method of simple rectification requires a high reflux ratio 
implying the use of columns with many stages, which lead automatically to higher pric-
es. In practice, the extractive distillation method is used for the acid acetic solution that 
has a concentration between 50 and 70%. It has been noticed that a ternary system has a 
high separation ratio using less energy than in the classical method. For mixtures which 
contain less than 40% acetic acid, the single solvent method is optimum. For choosing the 
right extractant, the scientists need to take into account the extractive capacity of the 
solvent and the equilibrium characteristics of the system [13]. 
In the azeotropic distillation method, a compound that in combination with water 
can decrease the boiling temperature of the mixture is used. Usually, if the substance is

Energies 2022, 15, 8119

not miscible with water, the distillation can be performed easily with high perspectives
for recycling [2]. Even though acetic acid and water solution does not form an azeotropic
mixture atmospheric pressure, the liquid system has a pinch tangent where they intercalate
on the pure water end. Another issue with this system is that acetic acid and water have
close boiling temperatures and that implies using multiple equilibrium stages and a huge
reﬂux ratio which automatically leads to increased difﬁculty of operating and controlling
the heterogenous azeotropic column. For these reasons, when separating the acetic acid
from water, an entrainer is usually used such as ethanol or iso propylic alcohols [14] or a
system formed from alcohol, cyclohexane, and water [15].
Hybrid separation is one of the methods for acetic acid recovery at industrial level. It
involves the liquid–liquid extraction followed by distillation. The purpose of the extraction
is to ﬁrst remove large amounts of water. The extraction is followed by two distillation
columns, one column for acetic acid recovery and another column for solvent recovery.
According to Angelo and co-authors, some important aspects should be taken into account
when hybrid separation schemas are proposed. These aspects refer to the number of stages
involved in the extraction column and in the distillation columns, but also to the extraction
efﬁciency in order to minimize the amount of energy involved in the distillation and in the
meantime to produce the desired acetic acid quantity and purity [9].
In the above-mentioned context, new methods for acetic acid concentration are in-
vestigated. These new methods are based on the process intensiﬁcation (PI) principles.
PI is a new area for research that has helped the chemical process industry gain new and
innovative ideas to solve processing problems such as using more efﬁcient technology,
designing smaller plants, assuring the safety and sustainability of a chemical process. Its
work is oriented to use as few devices as possible (by integrating more utilizations for a
single equipment), use mixing technologies so that heat and mass transfer are improved
by developing shorter pathways to ensure the diffusion, use new separation approaches,
new energy saving methods, new methods for better controlling, and having an optimized
plant. The objective of PI is to obtain sustainable ﬂow-sheet possibilities that include unit
operations that were subject to intensiﬁcation methods and who are subject to: already
mentioned process limitations, design objectives, and performances as verifying criteria.
When it comes to PI in the workplace, the main objective is to boost productivity, described
as the relationship created connecting all of the resource inputs necessary to complete the
activity and the production of an output [16–19]. PI has the ability to bring signiﬁcant bene-
ﬁts in terms of: obtaining a better efﬁciency of the system, increase the energy savings of the
plant, lower the costs that are implied by the buying of assets and the operation of the plant,
reduce the quantity of byproducts and waste, ensure the safety of the process. An example
of the PI use in the industry is the development and integration of the microreactors which
allow a careful selection of the products from the chemical transformation by offering a
precise process control, which ends up in decreasing the amount of waste that is produced
and usage of raw materials [20]. PI has been proved to be very helpful in the technologies
involving CO2 capture and utilization, resulting in lower energy consumption [21].
Distillation is a critical component of PI because it is an often-used separation technol-
ogy involved in the industry of synthetizing new chemicals. The biggest problem regarding
the distillation process is the amount of energy that is required [19]. This method uses
around 40–60% of the total amount of energy that is used in the chemical plants [22,23]. For
example, in the production of furfural, the reactive distillation column proved to be the
most energy demanding part of the simulation with a 69.82% of exergy efﬁciency, which
led to an overall exergy efﬁciency of 56.41%, even though the substance was obtained with
an yield of 97.4% and a purity of 99.96%. It was analyzed that by a 10% reduction of the
reboiler duty resulted in a 3.6% cost rate depletion [8].
Over time, several methods were developed (i.e., thermal coupling (TC), double effect
distillation (DED), vapor recompression) for reducing the amount of energy used for this
process [24]. As an alternative for using the TC method with similar energy savings, a PI
Energies 2022, 15, 8119
5 of 23
alternative solution would be the use of a side stream conﬁguration which allows a better
government of the production [25,26].
Moreover, the process of reactive distillation is complex since the analysis and the
designing of the process can become challenging by introducing auxiliary reactions into
the system. These problems were solved by Park and all (2020) by rigorously analyzing the
simulations and taking into account a residue curve map [27].
A series of TC conﬁgurations can be realized by associating the reboilers or the con-
densers from the system. The advantages of this technique are: a higher energy efﬁciency of
the process by using only a single reboiler and condenser in the whole system, there is also
zero external reﬂux and reboiler operation. All in all, this method has high potential and
effectiveness for reducing the energy consumption of the chemical plant [28]. Researchers
have shown that by using the TC conﬁgurations, the system could save up to 30% of its
energy usage, in comparison to the conventional methods. Overall, the PI approach of
distillation and the use of thermally coupled units open the door to numerous opportunities
in multicomponent distillation. The TC systems have the advantage of providing the same
results or better ones using fewer units of processing and it helps increase the suitability of
a plant [29]. Unfortunately, the energy that is served in the process needs to be supplied
to the reboiler at high temperatures and extracted from the condenser at low values of
temperature. Operation of the plant is made more difﬁcult since there are more connections
made between columns. Another issue is the increased number of trays and columns that
should be used in the distillation column for obtaining the same results as in an ordinary
system [29].
Another method for reducing the amount of energy used for a process is by using a
distillation column that utilizes the heat integration technique. This means that a distillation
column has a special conﬁguration that contains an internal heat integration. This is created
using the stripping sections of the column, which will act as the heat sink, and the rectifying
ones, that will produce the necessary heat used [30]. DED is usually used in combination
with other energy efﬁcient methods with the scope of reducing the amount of energy that
is consumed. In order to create a double-effect distillation, the heat used in a column is
driven to the precedent column so that the heat of the vapor can be used for the process
of the ﬁrst column, thus saving a reboiler or condenser regarding the heating and cooling
utilities [31]. Scientists tried to experiment with the use of heat pumps for reducing the
amount of resources used for the separation. For example, Gao and co-authors proposed a
new methodology to obtain isopropyl acetate by using a heat pump reactive distillation
process resulting in a decrease of the CO2 emissions by up to 13.25%, while the total annual
cost of production was 13.46% of the original process [32].
One way of obtaining acetic acid is concentrating it from diluted solutions obtained
using industrial or fermentation processes. Acetic acid is obtained and needs to be removed
from the solution in order to be processed further into other compounds. This paper aims
to simulate, using ChemCAD and COCO COFE software, different solvents and methods of
concentrating acetic acid from a diluted water solution in order to have a high concentrated
acetic acid and reduce the amount of energy consumed. The environmental evaluation is
also performed in the present research using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology
in order to ﬁnd relevant ways to reduce the impact of the proposed systems.
The technical and environmental evaluations of the proposed cases for acetic acid
concentration represent the novelty this research is bringing up.
2. Material and Methods
In order to reach the proposed goal, the following approach was used:
(i)
Perform the simulations for the various extractants (i.e., ethyl acetate, isopropanol,
and an isopropyl acetate—isopropanol mixture);
(ii)
Calculate the technical key performance indicators (i.e., acetic acid recovery, acetic
acid purity, extractant quantity, power consumption, energy consumption) based on
the material and energy balances derived from simulations;
Energies 2022, 15, 8119

(iii)
Screening of the best solvent, from the solvents listed in step (i), based on the results
obtained in step (ii);
(iv)
Apply process intensiﬁcation techniques (thermally coupling and double effect dis-
tillation) for the solvent with the best technical key performance indicators (solvent
decided in step (iii));
(v)
Perform the environmental evaluation, using a cradle-to-gate LCA, on the cases
decided on step (iv);
(vi)
Investigate, from environmental point of view, different scenarios for various steam
generation sources (i.e., hard coal, heavy fuel oil, light fuel oil, natural gas and
biomass);
(vii) Discuss the obtained results and draw the conclusions.
Details about process modeling and simulation as well as environmental evaluation
are provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2.
2.1. Process Modelling and Simulation
The initial acetic acid solution, containing 0.139 mole fraction of acetic acid, the rest
being water, needs to be concentrated. The most suitable way to separate acetic acid from
water, with an optimum amount of energy, is investigated considering the following case
studies.
Case 1—Acetic acid concentration using ethyl acetate;
Case 2—Acetic acid concentration using isopropyl acetate;
Case 3—Acetic acid concentration using isopropyl acetate and isopropanol mixture;
Case 4—Acetic acid concentration using isopropyl acetate and isopropanol mixture by TC;
Case 5—Acetic acid concentration using isopropyl acetate and isopropanol mixture by
DED.
In order to simulate the above-mentioned processes, ChemCAD process simulator
software (version 6.5.7) [33] and COCO COFE Cape Open software (version 3.5) [34] were
used. COCO (CAPE-OPEN to CAPE-OPEN) is a free-of-charge CAPE-OPEN compliant
steady-state simulation environment. COFE—the CAPE-OPEN Flowsheet Environment
is an intuitive graphical user interface to chemical ﬂow sheeting. COFE has sequential
solution algorithm using automatic tear streams. It displays properties of streams, deals
with unit-conversion, and provides plotting facilities. COFE ﬂowsheets can be used as
CAPE-OPEN unit operations; COFE ﬂowsheets can be used as unit operation inside COFE
(ﬂowsheets in ﬂowsheets) or inside other simulators.
The desired production capacity is 135 kmol/h (8095 kg/h) acetic acid (equivalent to
an annual production of 65,000 tons/year); the desired purity of the acetic acid being 0.99
(by weight).
UNIQUAC thermodynamic package was set for the ﬁve cases. It is assumed that
all the water streams that leave the system are blended and processed in a waste–water
treatment plant. The cases have been compared using technical KPIs indicators such as:
acetic acid ﬂow-rate, acetic acid purity, power consumption, thermal energy consumption,
number of unit operations, acetic acid recovery, etc. The description of each case as well as
the main assumptions used in the process modelling and simulation are presented in the
next section.
2.1.1. Case 1—Acetic Acid Concentration Using Ethyl Acetate
Acetic acid concentration using ethyl acetate is presented in Figure 3. In this case, the
simulation contains an extraction column (unit 1), an acid recovery column (unit 2), and a
solvent recovery column (unit 7). The simulation also contains two heat exchangers, one
cooler (unit 3) and one heater (unit 6), a decanter (unit 4) where the extractant (i.e., ethyl
acetate) is collected.

column (unit 7). The outputs stream of acid recovery column (unit 2) are: the acetic acid
stream (the main product) deﬁned as S5 having a ﬂow-rate of 113.39 kmol/h and a purity
of 0.94%, and the distillate stream, S4, containing 393.09 kmol/h water, 731.45 kmol/h ethyl
acetate, and 24.28 kmol/h acetic acid. S4 stream is sent to the heat exchanger where the
temperature is decreased from 77.17 ◦C to 25 ◦C. In the last distillation column, unit 7 in
Figure 3, the ethyl acetate is recovered in order to be recycled. The role of the decanter is to
store and recycle the solvent. The main design assumptions used in the present simulation
are summarized in Table 1.

337.96 kmol/h isopropyl acetate) streams. In the azeotropic column (unit 3), a two phases
separation takes place: from the bottom part of the azeotropic column, 135.06 kmol/h
of acetic acid with 0.99 mole fraction purity is extracted (S5 in Figure 4). The organic
solution obtained from the top of the azeotropic column contains isopropyl acetate and
water (S6 in Figure 4). The divider (unit 4) splits the stream in two parts. A ﬂow-ratio of
0.72 of solution is recycled as an extractant via Pump 12. Stream S18 and S10 are mixed and
reintroduced into the process, as Stream S20, while the rest of the ﬂow-rate that comes out
of the divider 4 is passed through the dehydration columns (unit 5 and unit 8). Stream S9
with a ﬂow-rate of 96.55 kmol/h of water (purity 99.14%), respectively stream S11 with
679.29 kmol/h (purity 98.01%) of water are obtained from the bottom of the dehydration
columns. These streams are mixed leading to Stream S12 which is sent to the wastewater
treatment plant (total ﬂow-rate 866.69 kmol/h). The top streams from both the dehydration
columns are mixed leading to Stream 19 having a ﬂow-rate of 22.69 kmol/h (containing
17.769 kmol/h water, 1 and 4.89 kmol/h of isopropyl acetate) which is sent to the mixer

2.1.3. Case 3—Acetic Acid Concentration Using Isopropyl Acetate and Isopropanol Mixture
The process is based on the information provided by Eun Joo Lee et al. [2]. The ﬁgure
looks similar to Figure 4, only the extractant used is different. In this case, a mixture of
isopropyl acetate and isopropanol was used.
The stream S1 containing 1000 kmol/h of acetic acid solution with the same compo-
nent ﬂow-rate, 861 kmol/h of water and 139 kmol/h acetic acid considered also in the
previous cases, is mixed in unit 2 with the recycle (S19 containing 45.48 kmol/h water,
1.26 × 10−2 kmol/h acetic acid, 9.52 kmol/h isopropanol and 5.29 kmol/h isopropyl ac-
etate) and the extractant streams (S20 with 173.58 kmol/h water, 15.38 kmol/h acetic acid,
5.54 kmol/h isopropanol and 6.51 kmol/h isopropyl acetate). The obtained mixed stream,
Stream S2, is sent to column 1 where the mixture is split in two fractions; the pressure of
these streams is 152 kPa. In the azeotropic column (unit 3), a two-phase separation takes
place: from the bottom part of the azeotropic column 134.89 kmol/h of acetic acid with
0.99 mole fraction purity is extracted (S5 in Figure 4). The organic solution obtained in the
top of the azeotropic column contains isopropanol and isopropyl acetate (S6 in Figure 4).
The divider (unit 4) splits the stream into two parts: 387.42 kmol/h of solution is recycled
as an extractant via Pump 12. Stream S18 and S10 are mixed and reintroduced into the
process, as Stream S20, while the rest of 151.77 kmol/h that comes out of the divider 4
is passed through the dehydration columns (unit 5 and 8). Stream S9 with a ﬂow-rate
of 97.84 kmol/h of water (purity 99.99%), respectively stream S11 with 767.27 kmol/h
(purity 99.45%) of water are obtained from the bottom of the dehydration columns. These
streams are mixed leading to Stream S12 which is sent to the wastewater treatment plant.
The top streams from both the dehydration columns are mixed leading to Stream 19 of
60.29 kmol/h (containing 45.48 kmol/h water, 1.26 × 10−2 kmol/h acetic acid, 9.51 kmol/h
of isopropanol and 5.29 kmol/h of isopropyl acetate) which is sent to the mixer (unit 2) for
recycling. The main assumptions used in the process modelling and simulation of this case

compositions, the columns can be combined so that they work as a single side stripper
azeotropic column as proposed by Caxiano et al. [35]. The simulation for case 4 contains
three columns: one absorption column, followed by an azeotropic distillation column and
a side stripper (see Figure 5).

2.2. Life Cycle Assessment
LCA is a standard methodology used for the environmental impact evaluation. Accord-
ing to ISO 14040 and 14044, the methodology involves the compilation and quantiﬁcation
of inputs and outputs for a given product/technology through its life cycle [36,37]. Data
about raw-materials, auxiliary materials (i.e., catalysts, solvents), energy, infrastructure,
product(s), by-product(s), various waste, and emissions have to be collected, quantiﬁed,
and used within LCA. LCA methodology contains four main steps as follows: (i) deﬁnition
of the goal and the scope of the LCA study, (ii) life cycle inventory (LCI), (iii) life cycle
impact assessment (LCIA) evaluation, and (iv) interpretation of the results. Details of the
above-mentioned steps are provided in the next section.
The goal of the present LCA was to compare the environmental aspects of acetic
acid concentration using conventional and PI methods. Since the acetic acid concentration
involves distillation processes in all investigated scenarios steam generation is an important
parameter consequently, various sources for steam generation have been investigated. The
electricity required for the processes is considered from the grid mix. The combination
of various types of steam with the electricity grid mix for case 4 and case 5 leads to ten
sub-cases which are summarized in Table 6.

GaBi software, version 10.5, developed by spheraTM was used in order to perform
the LCA calculations [38]. The study is a cradle-to-gate LCA study. The usage of the
concentrated acetic acid is not considered in the present research.
Data derived from process modelling and simulation have been considered as inputs
in the LCI. As underlined by Righi and co-authors [39], the usage of process simulators
to generate data for the LCI offers a series of advantages such as: (i) detailed mass and
energy data about each equipment involved in the process schema; (ii) a quick screening of
alternative plant conﬁgurations; (iii) the possibility to perform sensitivity analysis in order
to understand the inﬂuence of the input variables on the outputs; and (iv) a relative ease in
studying opportunities of process integration. An example of LCI is provided in Figure 7.

and hydrogen. The catalyst preparation is done in a separate reactor to ensure 
proper dissolving. In this process a rhodium catalyst is used. 
Isopropanol 
production 
Isopropanol is manufactured by propene by indirect hydrogenation in two 
steps: esterification of sulphate acid with propene and hydrogenation of the 
formed sulphate esters with steam. The product is neutralized by caustic soda 
solution and purified in a refining column. The by-products (di iso-propyl ether 
and others) are recovered and recycled to the process. 
Iso-propyl 
acetate 
production 
Isopropyl acetate was generated from acetic acid and isopropanol according to 
the following chemical reaction: 
CH3COOH + C3H8O → C5H10O2 + H2O 
Stoichiometric quantities of materials have been considered in the LCA.

Assumptions
Acetic acid production
Low-pressure methanol carbonylation in one step is considered. Methanol
and carbon monoxide are continuously fed into the stirred reactor in which
the reaction is conducted at 200 ◦C and 35 bars. Most noticeable
by-products (however produced in very little quantities) are propionic acid,
carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The catalyst preparation is done in a
separate reactor to ensure proper dissolving. In this process a rhodium
catalyst is used.
Isopropanol production
Isopropanol is manufactured by propene by indirect hydrogenation in two
steps: esteriﬁcation of sulphate acid with propene and hydrogenation of
the formed sulphate esters with steam. The product is neutralized by
caustic soda solution and puriﬁed in a reﬁning column. The by-products
(di iso-propyl ether and others) are recovered and recycled to the process.

Assumptions
Electricity from grid mix
The national or regional speciﬁc electricity consumption mix is provided
by the conversion of the different energy carriers to electricity and imports
from neighboring countries. The electricity is either produced in energy
carrier speciﬁc power plants and/or combined heat and power plants
(CHP). Moreover, the national and regional speciﬁc technology standards
of the power plants are considered with regard to efﬁciency, ﬁring
technology, ﬂue-gas desulphurization, NOx removal, and de-dusting. The
fossil power plant models combine emission data from the literature with
calculated values for non-measured emissions. Combustion residues from
solid fuels, such as gypsum, bottom ash, or ﬂy ash are assumed to be
reused. Waste treatment for these substances is not considered. The supply
chain is modelled in speciﬁc national/regional energy carrier consumption
mixes (i.e., domestic production and imports), and considers
national/regional average energy carrier properties (i.e., elemental
composition and energy content).
Steam generation
The process steam is produced in speciﬁc heat plants using hard coal,
heavy fuel oil, heavy fuel oil, light fuel oil, natural gas or biomass. The
national and regional speciﬁc technology standards of the heat plants are
also considered with regard to efﬁciency, ﬁring technology, ﬂue-gas
desulphurization, NOx removal and de-dusting. Only single fuels are
considered; their combination was not investigated in the present research.
The power plant models combine emission data from the literature with
calculated values for non-measured. Combustion residues from solid fuels,
such as gypsum, bottom ash, or ﬂy ash are assumed to be reused. The
supply chain of the raw-material used for steam generation is also
considered from exploration, production, processing, and transport of the
fuels to the heat plants.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Results and Discussions on Process Modelling and Simulation
The ﬁrst simulation, case 1, illustrated in Figure 3 was performed using the COCO
COFE simulator and according to the literature [9]. The second and the third simulation,
case 2 and case 3, illustrated in Figure 4, were performed according to the information
from the original literature source [35]. In case 4, illustrated in Figure 5, the combination
of the two columns into a single side stripper that is connected to the stream that comes
out of the azeotropic column so that the TC process can be established between those two
units is proposed. This case considered a PI improvement for two reasons: (i) a lower
number of unit operations are used in this case compared to case 3 and (ii) according to
the literature [40], the TC is a PI Process strategy that should lower the amount of energy
consumed by up to 30%. The aim of the simulation for case 5, illustrated in Figure 6,
was to reduce the energy consumption even more, using a DED conﬁguration, which is
another method of PI. The side stripper from case 4 was redesigned into the thermally
equivalent column 8 (case 5) so that a heat integrating system can be obtained with the
azeotropic column. The above-mentioned conﬁgurations have been proposed considering
their potential to reduce the energy and power consumption, to reduce the costs since
less equipment pieces are involved and also to reduce the environmental impact of the
acetic acid concentration system. The main streams resulting from process modeling and
simulation for the ﬁve cases under study are summarized in the Supplementary Material
as follows: Table S1 for case 1, Table S2 for case 2, Table S3 for case 3, Table S4 for case 4
and Table S5 for case 5). In all the simulations, the quantity of the raw-material that is
introduced in the system is 1000 kmol/h containing 0.139 acetic acid and 0.861 water (mole
fraction). Beside the raw-material stream and the output streams, other recycled streams
are considered for each case, their ﬂow-rates and compositions vary from case to case. The

results obtained in the proposed simulations have been validated, being very close to the
values from the original literature [9,35].

As noticed from Table 8, the highest quantity of acid is obtained in case 5, followed
closely by the results of case 3 and case 2 (e.g., 136 kmol/h in case 5 followed by 135.54 in
case 3, respectively 135.06 kmol/h in case 2). The purity of the acid from case 1 is 0.94 while
in cases 2, 3, 4, 5 it is higher having a value of 0.99. Another parameter which has been
calculated is the acetic acid recovery. It is the ratio between the quantity of pure acetic acid
obtained and the quantity of acetic acid introduced in the system by Stream 1, the diluted
acetic acid solution which should be concentrated. The highest value for this parameter
was registered for case 5 (i.e., 97.74%) being followed closely by the other PI case, case 4
with a recovery rate of about 97.42%. The lowest value for this parameter is also registered
in the ﬁrst case when ethyl acetate is used as an extractant.
The ﬂow-rates of extractants have also been reported in Table 8. The lowest quantity
of extractant is used in case 5 (e.g., 344.21 kmol/h) while the highest ﬂow-rate is used in
case 1 (e.g., 938.65 kmol/h).
By comparing the number of units utilized in the simulations, it can be noticed that
the lowest number is registered for case 1 but also the performances of this case (i.e., acetic
acid ﬂow-rate, acetic acid purity, acetic acid recovery) are not so high. Compering the other
cases in terms of number of units used, it can be noticed that in case 4 a number of 9 units
are used, in case 5 a number of 13 units are used while in cases 2 and 3 a number of 14 units
are employed. Cases 4 and 5 are favorable because the number of columns is reduced from
3 to 2. For case 2 and case 3, the number of units is determined by the presence of more
mixers, pumps, and heat exchangers.
Observing the values from the power consumption parameter and energy parame-
ter, it can be noticed that case 5 consumes the highest quantity of power, but it has the
lowest usage of energy. The most power efﬁcient scenario for acetic acid concentration is
represented by case 4.
In terms of energy consumption, case 5 is the optimum consumer, followed by case 4.
The energy consumption in case 5 is lower than the amount of energy used in case 4 (e.g.,
33,640 MJ/h in case 5 vs. 40,646 MJ/h in case 4), which means a reduction of the quantity of
Energies 2022, 15, 8119
19 of 23
used energy of 17.23% which is in the range of the energy saving mentioned in the scientiﬁc
literature [29]. When comparing case 5 to case 3, we notice that a consumption reduction of
23.37% was registered. The energy consumption between cases 2 and 3 is pretty close as
can be observed from Table 8.
As a general conclusion on the technical assessment, case 5 seems to be the most
favorable one since: (i) The highest quantity of acetic acid is obtained (e.g., 135.86 kmol/h);
(ii) it presents the highest acid recovery rate (e.g., 97.74%); (iii) it uses the lowest quantity of
extractant (e.g., 344.21 kmol/h); (iv) a number of two columns are involved; (v) it presents
the lowest energy usage (e.g., 33,640 MJ/h).
3.2. Results and Discussion on LCA
After technical screening, the most promising cases, case 4 and case 5, were investi-
gated from the environmental point of view. These cases lead to ten subcases as mentioned
in Table 6. The most relevant environmental KPIs derived from the LCA study, using
ReCiPe impact assessment method, are reported in Tables 9 and 10.
The LCA results reported in Tables 9 and 10 can be compared using three strategies
as follows: (i) a general comparison (i.e., case 4 vs. case 5) and more detailed comparison
referring to (ii) the results of various sub-cases which use the same steam source should be
put one against the other (i.e., sub-case 4.1 vs. sub-case 5.1, sub-case 4.2 vs. sub-case 5.2,
sub-case 4.3 vs. sub-case 5.3, etc.) and (iii) various sub-cases within the same case study
(i.e., sub-case 4.1 vs. sub-cases 4.2, 4.3, 4.4., and 4.5, etc.).
Generally, the values for case 4 are higher than the values correspondent to case 5 except
the values for the ozone depletion potential (ODP) indicator. The values are double or more
than double for all the impact categories summarized in Tables 9 and 10. For instance, for
the climate change, defined also as global warming potential (GWP) indicator, the ratio of the
values for case 4 and the values for case 5 are in the range 2.10–2.35. The highest differences
between case 4 and case 5 are registered for the human toxicity potential (HTP) indicator. For
this indicator, the values are about 2.34 times higher in case 4 vs. the value registered for case 5.
Having a look deeper into detail and comparing the same sub-cases, if for instance
sub-case 4.1 is compared to sub-case 5.1, the values correspondent to the climate change
are 10.95 kg CO2 eq./kg acetic acid respectively 5.22 kg CO2 eq./kg acetic acid. A detailed
contribution to this indicator is illustrated in Figure 9. As noticed from Figure 9, the acetic
acid production from methanol, isopropanol production, and steam production are the
biggest contributors to the climate change indicator.

Analyzing the LCA results within the same case study (i.e., sub-case 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
4.4, 4.5), it can be observed that the steam source inﬂuences the environmental indicators
as follows: the highest values for the impact indicators are registered for the usage of
fossil fuels while the lowest are registered for the biomass usage as steam source (i.e.,
climate change indicator (GWP), fossil depletion potential (FDP), terrestrial ecotoxicity
potential (TETP)). The exceptions are represented by the freshwater eutrophication potential
indicator (FEP) and water depletion potential (WDP) where the opposite situation occurs.
Other impact indicators such as ODP, HTP have constant or slightly different values
independently of the steam generation source. Between the fossil fuels investigated for
the steam generation, the usage of natural gas leads to lower environmental impact values
compared to the usage of hard coal, heavy or light fuel oil.

The LCA results reported in Tables 9 and 10 can be compared using three strategies 
as follows: (i) a general comparison (i.e., case 4 vs. case 5) and more detailed comparison 
referring to (ii) the results of various sub-cases which use the same steam source should 
be put one against the other (i.e., sub-case 4.1 vs. sub-case 5.1, sub-case 4.2 vs. sub-case 
5.2, sub-case 4.3 vs. sub-case 5.3, etc.,) and (iii) various sub-cases within the same case 
study (i.e., sub-case 4.1 vs. sub-cases 4.2, 4.3, 4.4., and 4.5, etc.,). 
Generally, the values for case 4 are higher than the values correspondent to case 5 
except the values for the ozone depletion potential (ODP) indicator. The values are dou-
ble or more than double for all the impact categories summarized in Tables 9 and 10. For 
instance, for the climate change, defined also as global warming potential (GWP) indi-
cator, the ratio of the values for case 4 and the values for case 5 are in the range 2.10–2.35. 
The highest differences between case 4 and case 5 are registered for the human toxicity 
potential (HTP) indicator. For this indicator, the values are about 2.34 times higher in case 
4 vs. the value registered for case 5.

sub-case 4.1 is compared to sub-case 5.1, the values correspondent to the climate change 
are 10.95 kg CO2 eq./kg acetic acid respectively 5.22 kg CO2 eq./kg acetic acid. A detailed 
contribution to this indicator is illustrated in Figure 9. As noticed from Figure 9, the acetic 
acid production from methanol, isopropanol production, and steam production are the 
biggest contributors to the climate change indicator.

compared to the usage of hard coal, heavy or light fuel oil. 
From technical and environmental point of view, it can be concluded that the usage 
of double effect distillation using isopropanol and isopropyl acetate mixture as extractant 
coupled with the usage of biomass as a steam source represent the most efficient and 
environmentally friendly option. 
4. Conclusions 
The present study aims to investigate, using process modelling and environmental 
tools (i.e., ChemCAD, COCO COFE and GaBi software), which is the best configuration, 
from technical and environmental perspectives, to concentrate acetic acid. Five case 
studies were explored and compared in the present research. The cases under investiga-
tion use different extractants (i.e., ethyl acetate, isopropanol and an isopropyl ace-
tate—isopropanol mixture) and different technologies i) classical (i.e., extraction and 
azeotropic distillation) and ii) intensified (i.e., TC and DED). The five configurations 
under study are represented by extraction (case 1), azeotropic concentration design (case 
2, case 3), and two process intensification designs based on TC (case 4) and DED (case 5).

The present study aims to investigate, using process modelling and environmental
tools (i.e., ChemCAD, COCO COFE and GaBi software), which is the best conﬁguration,
from technical and environmental perspectives, to concentrate acetic acid. Five case studies
were explored and compared in the present research. The cases under investigation use

and ii) intensiﬁed (i.e., TC and DED). The ﬁve conﬁgurations under study are represented
by extraction (case 1), azeotropic concentration design (case 2, case 3), and two process
intensiﬁcation designs based on TC (case 4) and DED (case 5).
The main tools used in the present work for process modeling and simulation are
ChemCAD version 6.5.7, developed by ChemstationsTM and COCO COFE simulator, ver-
sion 3.5, developed by AmsterCHEM. GaBi software, version 10.5, developed by spheraTM,
was used to perform the LCA.
The main ﬁndings derived from the work performed are summarized as follows:
(i)
The technical comparison leads to the conclusion that the highest quantity of acetic
acid is obtained in case 5. The purity is 0.94 in case 1, while for the rest of the cases it
reaches 0.99. For properly comparing the three simulations, the energy consumption
should be taken into consideration. In terms of energy consumption, case 5 is the
optimum consumer, followed by case 1 and case 4. Even if the energy consumption
in case 1 is low, the other technical KPIs (i.e., acetic acid ﬂow-rate, acetic acid purity,
quantity of extractant used) are the highest and do not support this scenario.
(ii)
The environmental comparison, based on the ReCiPe impact assessment method leads
to the conclusion that the most environmentally friendly process is the DED coupled
with steam generation from biomass.
