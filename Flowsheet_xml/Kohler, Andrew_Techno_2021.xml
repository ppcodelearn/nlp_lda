Abstract: A readily available source for renewable fuels and chemicals is corn stover, which consists
of the leftover stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs from the corn plant and makes up nearly half of the yield
of a corn crop. Common practice is to pretreat it with sulfuric acid to break down the hemicellulose,
releasing xylose, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to convert the cellulose into glucose. Using a
Sn-Beta catalyst, it is possible to convert these monomeric sugars into lactic, levulinic, formic, and
acetic acids. This paper presents the results of a techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the commercial
feasibility of producing these acids from corn stover. Two preliminary process designs were evaluated
which represent two separate reaction yields: a balanced yield of both lactic and levulinic acids and
the yields from a co-catalysis with CaSO4 to produce primarily lactic acid. Both process designs
are scaled to process 230,000 MT/year of corn stover. An AACS Class 4 factored broad capital cost
estimate and comparable estimates of operating costs and revenues were used to generate cash ﬂow
sheets to evaluate the economic feasibility of both options. The balanced product process has an
estimated NPV@20% = $3.3 million ± 40%, while the CaSO4-facilited process has an NPV@20%
= $110 million ± 40% (January 2019 basis). A major hurdle for both processes is the demand for
levulinic acid. The balanced product process will produce 135% of the expected global demand and
the CaSO4-facilitated alternative will meet 31% of the demand. For the demand to meet production,
advances in levulinic acid applications are needed. However, the attractive economics suggest that
these technologies warrant further development towards commercialization.

1. Introduction
Changes to the global environment have resulted in a concerted effort to transition
away from petroleum as a feedstock for fuel and chemical production. Lignocellulosic
biomass is a desirable alternative carbon source, as the world’s ability to produce ligno-
cellulosic biomass is substantial. One of the most readily available sources in the United
State is corn stover, which consists of the leftover stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs from
the corn plant and makes up nearly half of the yield of a corn crop. These components
are rich in structural carbohydrates, comprising about 60% of the dry weight (35.1% glu-
can and 19.5% xylan) [1]. The structural nature of corn stover makes it difﬁcult to break
down into sugars which can be used to produce renewable fuels and chemicals. Common
practice for lignocellulosic materials such as corn stover is to pretreat them with sulfuric
acid [2]. The acid breaks down the hemicellulose, releasing xylose, and makes the rest of
the carbohydrates more accessible. Enzymes are then utilized to break apart the cellulose,
releasing glucose [1].
Using a Sn-Beta catalyst, it is possible to convert the monomeric sugars (glucose and
xylose) to more lucrative products such as lactic and levulinic acid as well as by-products

such as formic and acetic acid [3–6]. The reaction of glucose follows one of two reaction
pathways. The ﬁrst is retro-aldol condensation, which splits the six-carbon sugar in the
presence of a Lewis acid [7]. This produces two three-carbon trioses, which can both be
isomerized to lactic acid [7]. As a side reaction, these trioses can decompose to acetic and
formic acids [8]. Glucose can also triple dehydrate in the presence of a Brønsted acid into
5-hydoxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) [9]. In the presence of water, a 5-HMF molecule can
rehydrate and form a ﬁve-carbon levulinic acid molecule and a one-carbon formic acid
molecule [9]. Xylose, a pentose, is stoichiometrically limited to one lactic acid through
retro-aldol condensation. Additionally, when dehydrated, xylose transforms into ﬁve-
carbon furfural.
Lactic acid is a renewable chemical that can serve as an alternative to fossil fuel
derivatives. It serves as a platform chemical in applications across a wide-range of indus-
tries including cosmetics, food, pharmaceuticals, and, most prominently, biodegradable
plastics [10–13]. Traditional synthesis methods through fermentation have proven costly,
making it difﬁcult for its subsequent products to economically compete. More economical
production can be achieved by chemical pathways, instead of biological. This is not optimal
for its main application, polylactic acid (PLA), as it produces a racemic mixture of lactic
acid. However, this mixture can still be used in biodegradable polymer production through
intermediate conversion to acrylic acid or propylene glycol [12].
Initial studies found that optimum lactic acid yield was achieved using methanol as
the reaction solvent [14,15]. This results in the formation of ester derivatives of the target
products (i.e., methyl lactate instead of lactic acid). Production of these derivatives would
require alternative uses for the end-products or subsequent conversion of the esters to
carboxylic acids. An additional drawback of this pathway is that sugars are hydrolyzed
from biomass in aqueous solutions. Thus, energy-intensive steps would be required to
extract the sugars out of their water solution so they can be transferred to methanol, as
well as to extract the methyl ester forms of the product acids out of the methanol solvent
for use as products.
Our recent work [16] found that the addition of CaSO4 to aqueous reactions mixtures
can result in lactic acid yields comparable to those achieved in methanol. This is due to
sulfate ions present in the solution that help to neutralize Brønsted acid sites present on
the surface of Sn-Beta. The loss of these sites suppresses the production of dehydration
side-products. Additionally, calcium ions act as a second Lewis acid, acting in tandem with
tin to improve the yield of the retro-aldol pathway. This results in a lactic acid yield of
68 wt% of the inlet carbon, signiﬁcantly closer to the 75% yield obtained in methanol [15].
Levulinic acid has been a chemical of interest for many years due to its potential to be
converted into valuable products such as γ-valerolactone (GVL), which can be used as a
liquid solvent or as a transition chemical to other products. GVL has potential as a fuel
additive, as it has shown similar properties to ethanol when mixed with octane [17]. Its
chemical and physical properties give it applications as a green solvent since it is renewable,
non-toxic, and biodegradable [18].
An industrial scale process was developed by Bioﬁne Renewables to produce levulinic
acid using the cellulose and hemicellulose in agricultural residues [19]. However, as with
many chemical intermediates, the economics for large-scale production of levulinic acid as
a primary product appear challenging. It may be more economical to produce levulinic
acid as a co-product with another chemical product, such as lactic acid, that can generate
a higher revenue stream. In our recent work [16], a balanced product suite consisting of
12 wt% lactic acid and 15 wt% levulinic acid (inlet carbon basis) was produced from a
model corn stover-derived sugars solution using Sn-Beta for the catalytic sugar reactions.
These data formed the basis for the work presented in this study.
This paper presents the results of a techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the commercial
feasibility to utilize Sn-Beta-facilitated reactions to produce biorenewable chemicals from
corn stover. Although extensive work has gone into understanding and optimizing the
yield from Sn-Beta, the economics of the current state of the technology have not been

evaluated [3–6,14–16]. Herein, two process designs are evaluated which represent the two
separate reaction yields from Sn-Beta described above. The ﬁrst uses optimized reaction
conditions that produce a balanced yield of both lactic and levulinic acids. The second uses
the co-catalysis of Sn-Beta and CaSO4 to almost exclusively produce lactic acid. Details
on both reactions can be found in Kohler et. al. 2020 [16]. Both process designs are scaled
to utilize 30 wt% of the corn stover produced from the quantity of corn fed to a typical
corn ethanol plant located in the Upper Midwest of the U.S. The remaining 70 wt% of the
harvested corn stover is typically recycled back into the soil for quality preservation [1].
This equates to about 230,000 metric tons (MT) of corn stover per year as feed to the process
for both alternatives.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Reactive Extraction
To aid in designing the process’s separation steps, lab-scale reactive extraction experi-
ments were conducted. Extraction used trioctylamine (TOA, 98% purity, EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) as the reactive extractant. It works by creating an ion-pair with the
target organic acids. Isoamyl alcohol (98% purity, TCI America, Portland, OR, USA) or
1-octanol (99% purity, Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) were used as active diluents
to solvate the carboxylic acid-amine ion-pairs.
Each extraction experiment utilized 5.00 g of a carboxylic acid solution containing
lactic, levulinic, acetic, and formic acids in water in a test tube. Acid concentrations
were altered by mixing or diluting available solutions to meet the intended concentration.
Trioctylamine was then added with either isoamyl alcohol or 1-octanol as the diluent to
meet the intended extractant concentration and organic-to-aqueous phase ratio. Test tubes
were then placed on an Innova model 40 shaker table (New Brunswick, Edison, USA)
for the intended extraction time. The table was enclosed and the temperature closely
controlled. After extraction, the solution was allowed to settle and separate. If the phases
took more than ten minutes to separate, the sample was centrifuged for ﬁve minutes. The
organic layer was then removed using a syringe.
Initial and ﬁnal acid concentrations of the aqueous phase were quantiﬁed using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Agilent Technologies 1200 series, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Separation occurred using an Agilent Hi-Plex H organic acid column with a
mobile phase of 5 mM H2SO4. The HPLC operated at a mobile phase ﬂow of 0.6 mL/min
at 40 ◦C. A refractive index detector (G1362A: Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
was used and measured each analyte for up to 75 min.
Extraction factors such as aqueous/organic phase ratio, initial acid composition, ex-
tractant concentration, extraction time, and extraction temperature were screened using a
six factor, half factorial design (Resolution VI). Solvent loading, extractant concentration,
and initial acid composition were found to have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on distribu-
tion coefﬁcients for the target acids and were further optimized using a central composite
design of experiments. Relative effects of each variable for both designs were analyzed
using Minitab™ software (NIST, v.18).
2.2. Design
A preliminary design for each process was created by identifying and approximating,
using preliminary design techniques, the necessary process steps to transform corn stover
into the target organic acids and the subsequent separation steps to obtain saleable purities.
Temperature and pressure proﬁles were developed to estimate heat transfer and motive
force requirements. Equipment sizing was estimated using Ulrich [20] and the ChemCadTM
process simulation application. Corn stover hydrolysis design was based on current and
target yields speciﬁed by the National Renewable Laboratory (NREL) [1,21]. In addition to
equipment sizing, utilities and chemical requirements were also estimated. The process
design was summarized and depicted in process ﬂow diagrams.

2.3. Economic Analysis
A broad capital cost estimate was developed using an Association for the Advance-
ment of Cost Engineers (AACS) Class 4 factored estimating method [22] at an accuracy of
±40%. Vendor estimates were obtained for compressors and rotary vacuum ﬁlters. All
other equipment costs plus all of the estimating factors were estimated using cost charts in
Ulrich [20] and used to calculate a total bare module cost. Contingency and fees of 18% of
the total bare module cost were added to produce the total module cost. To account for
building costs, site preparation, and offsite areas, an auxiliary factor of 30% of the total
module cost was included to yield the ﬁxed capital investment (FCI). The costs for the
initial charge of solvents and catalysts and working capital (15% of FCI) were added to the
FCI to yield a total capital investment (TCI).
In addition, revenues and operating costs were estimated at an equivalent level of
accuracy. The unit prices of all products, raw materials, chemicals, and catalysts were
calculated based on their historical price trend at the basis date of January 2019. When
price history was unavailable, spot prices were used. The following additional operating
expenses were estimated: operating labor, maintenance, utilities, wastewater treatment,
and general allocated expenses. Utility costs were calculated for steam, cooling, and boiler
feed water from prices estimated with correlations based on capacity and fuel cost found
in Ulrich [20].
Proﬁtability was calculated using a cash ﬂow sheet method with an assumed facility
operating life of 20 years. The ﬁxed capital investment was spread across the preliminary
project development schedule (Years −2 to 0). Initial solvent and catalyst expenses and
working capital were applied immediately before operation (Year 0) and the working
capital was recovered in the ﬁnal year of operation (Year 20). Income tax requirements
were estimated by calculating the gross proﬁt (revenue less the operating costs). Depreci-
ation based on a 17-year modiﬁed accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) (full year
convention) of the ﬁxed capital investment was subtracted from the gross proﬁt for each
year of operation, yielding the federal taxable proﬁt. Federal taxes were applied at the
2019 rate of 21%. State taxable proﬁt was calculated as the federal taxable proﬁt less the
federal income tax. State tax was applied at the 2019 North Dakota rate of 4.31% [23].
Net proﬁt after process commissioning (Years 1–20) was calculated as gross proﬁt minus
federal and state taxes. Annual net proﬁts were discounted to year 0 using a hurdle rate
(discount factor) of 20%. The NPV@20% was calculated as the sum of the discounted net
proﬁt of each year and the DCFROR was calculated by ﬁnding the hurdle rate at which the
NPV@DCFROR = $0 (USD, United States Dollars).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Process Design—Sugar Recovery and Conversion
The design was formulated using various data generated previously. The technology
readiness levels for the various sections of the process are as follows:
•
Areas 01 and 02: Corn stover extraction, TRL 7—the technology has been demon-
strated at the pilot scale level by the US DOE National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL).
•
Area 03: Catalytic reactions to convert corn stover, TRL 2—this design is based
on novel research results from a recent study on reaction conditions in a lab-scale
batch reactor.
•
Areas 04/05: Separation and puriﬁcation, TRL 3—this design is based on new experi-
mental data related to the solvent extraction steps.
Both processes were scaled to utilize the corn stover generated by farmers who sell
their corn to a typical bioethanol plant in the US Midwest Corn Belt. This would allow
for the utilization of existing distribution networks, ensuring proper supply of the raw
material. A single bushel of corn (about 25 kg) produces about 10.6 L of ethanol [30] and
every kg of harvested corn produces about 1.0 kg of corn stover [1]. Not all corn stover
is usable, however, since 70% of it is required to remain in the soil for erosion control [1].
In North Dakota, the average nameplate capacity of a corn ethanol bio-reﬁnery is about
360 million liters per year [31], making a process feed of about 230,000 MTs of corn stover
per year.
An overview of both process alternatives can be seen in Figure 1. Both alternatives
were split into ﬁve process areas. Process area 01 is the corn stover pretreatment area.
Process area 02 is the glucose recovery area. Process area 03 is the Sn-Beta catalytic reaction
area. Process area 04 is the acetic and formic acid puriﬁcation area and process area 05 is
the lactic and levulinic acid puriﬁcation area. Complete process ﬂow diagrams (PFDs) with
more detailed information on both designs are provided in Supplementary Materials.
Equipment requirements for both process alternatives were similar, with the only
functional difference originating in the addition of calcium sulfate before the catalytic
reactor in the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative. This addition signiﬁcantly shifts the selectivity
of the reaction to almost exclusively produce lactic acid. Reaction yields applied to both
processes can be seen in Table 1 and were based on the experimental work described in
Kohler et. al., 2020 [16]. Subsequent separation units in both process alternatives have
identical functionality and are scaled to ﬁt the differing reaction yields.

Process areas 01 and 02 are identical for both processes and are focused on the ex-
traction and recovery of glucose and xylose from corn stover. Before being transferred
on site, corn stover is assumed to be dried and milled to a mean size of 4–5.8 mm for
efﬁcient transportation (not shown). In process area 01, corn stover is fed into the process
and initially treated with a 0.4 wt% sodium hydroxide solution [1]. This treatment acts
primarily to remove acetate groups that are mostly included in the hemicellulose portion
of the biomass. Removal of the acetate groups allows for easier access to the xylan in the
subsequent acid hydrolysis step [2]. The xylan in the hemicellulose is then depolymerized
Processes 2021, 9, 436

with 0.3 wt% sulfuric acid in the acid hydrolysis reactor to produce xylose. The remaining
corn stover solids are then removed and rinsed with process water in a rotary vacuum
ﬁlter. The ﬁltered acid hydrolysate is then neutralized with calcium carbonate, producing
calcium sulfate.
The corn stover solids remaining after acid hydrolysis are routed to process area
02. Here, the corn stover solids are mixed with cellulase enzymes, which react with the
cellulose portion of the solids, liberating glucose. This enzymatic hydrolysis occurs at
a solids loading of 20 wt%, which is too high for the solution to be pumped. Therefore,
the reaction is performed in a vertical continuous reactor allowing mixture transport by
gravity. At a residence time of 24 h, the enzymes break down the solids enough for
them to be pumped to a batch reactor. The remainder of the enzymatic reaction occurs in
this reactor for an additional 60 h. This results in an overall 95 wt% conversion of inlet
cellulose to glucose. The design for the ﬁrst two process areas is consistent with target
sugars yields from corn stover outlined by NREL for the catalytic conversion of sugars
into hydrocarbons [21].
The sugars extracted by acid and enzymatic hydrolysis in process areas 01 and 02 are
then combined in process area 03. For the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative, calcium sulfate
is added at this point to produce a saturated solution. The sugar solutions are then
fed to multiple parallel Sn-Beta reactors where competing retro-aldol condensation and
dehydration reactions produce lactic, levulinic, acetic, and formic acids. The reactors are
designed for a reaction temperature of 200 ◦C and a residence time of 2 h.
It is of note that in our experimental work we observed a decreased product yield
from biomass derived feeds when compared to model solutions at the same catalyst-to-
sugars ratio in the reactor [16]. We hypothesize that this was due to the presence of ash
from the biomass, which led to catalyst deactivation [32]. Therefore, we assumed (design
assumption 6, noted above) that 75% of the ash is solubilized in the initial washing step in
process area 01 [21], signiﬁcantly mitigating this issue.
The balance of the carbon not speciﬁed in the reaction yields on Table 1 is assumed
to be converted into hydrocar as a result of intra- and intermolecular dehydration of
the sugars [26]. It is assumed that the hydrochar can be calcined off the catalyst with
compressed air at 260 ◦C. To accomplish this, 2 of the 18 available reactors are ofﬂine at any
time, allowing for continual catalyst regeneration. For a reactor to go ofﬂine, its outlet lactic
acid concentration would have to drop below an acceptable standard, indicating subpar
catalyst activity. Once this occurs, the reactor is then drained and fed with compressed
air. The hydrochar on the catalyst is then calcined to carbon dioxide until completely
removed. The reactor will then be reactivated once a separate reactor reached the minimum
reaction conversion.
Also in process area 03, furfural generated as a side product through acid hydrolysis
is removed from the process stream. This is accomplished through liquid-liquid extraction
where furfural is extracted with toluene, which does not have any afﬁnity for the produced
carboxylic acids [33].
3.2. Process Design—Acid Recovery and Puriﬁcation
In both alternatives, process areas 04 and 05 were designed to recover and purify
the target acid products. The initial hurdle in product puriﬁcation is to remove the water
from the dilute acid stream (acid concentration is ~4 wt%). This can be done by reactive
extraction where a basic tertiary amine can react with the carboxylic acids, yielding a
non-polar ion pair [34–36]. The high viscosity and tension of these amines create transport
limitations when used on an industrial scale [37]. To mitigate these limitations, a diluent
can be added to improve its physical properties and aid in separation [37]. Though there is
a general consensus on which amine extractant (trioctylamine, TOA) and diluents (C5–C10
alcohols) are most effective for extraction of these acids, consistent conditions for their
co-extraction are not available [33,34,38,39].

To account for this lack of data, lab scale extraction experiments were conducted to
determine the optimum conditions for co-extraction of lactic, levulinic, acetic, and formic
acids in TOA diluted by one of two diluents, 1-octanol or isoamyl alcohol. Initially, four
factors were screened for their effect on extraction: aqueous/organic phase ratio, extractant
concentration, extraction time, and extraction temperature. Acid composition (speciﬁed as
the lactic/levulinic acid ratio) was also screened to determine the effect of selectivity from
the prior reaction on extraction effectiveness.
Based on the distribution coefﬁcients (KD) of the acids, it was determined by the
screening experiments that the most inﬂuential factors were: aqueous/organic phase
ratio, extractant concentration, and acid composition. For diluents, isoamyl alcohol was
signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than 1-octanol. However, the high solubility of isoamyl alcohol
in water, along with the similarity in boiling points of isoamyl alcohol and formic acid,
raise downstream processing concerns. Thus, it was determined to study both diluents in
further tests.
Optimization of the most inﬂuential factors occurred using two identical central com-
posite designs. These designs were created to determine the conditions which yielded
optimum co-extraction of the acids with 1-octanol and isoamyl alcohol as diluents, respec-
tively. For co-extraction, more weight was given to the harder to extract acids (levulinic and
acetic) when determining optimum conditions. The resulting conditions and distribution
coefﬁcients can be seen in Table 2.

Operating conditions for isoamyl alcohol as the diluent resulted in marginally bet-
ter distribution coefﬁcients and 25% lower organic phase requirements compared to
1-octanol. However, downstream separation would be much more challenging with
isoamyl alcohol compared to 1-octanol. Simple process designs for both diluents, seen in
Figures 2 and 3, were created to weigh the economic costs of using each diluent as applied
to the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process alternative.
For both diluent processes, the extracted carboxylic acids are back extracted out of the
non-polar amine mixture into a more volatile polar solvent for easier recovery. This can be
accomplished by using a trimethylamine (TMA) in water mixture as the back extractant.
TMA forms polar ion-pairs with the acids. One drawback of using a TMA/water mixture as
the back extractant is that water forms azeotropes with both acetic and formic acid. When
1-octanol is used as the diluent for TOA in the initial extraction, acetic and formic acids
can be distilled out of the non-polar acid-rich mixture prior back extraction, which is then
only used to recover lactic and levulinic acid. Due to a formic acid/1-octanol azeotrope
(98.5 mol% formic acid), size exclusion adsorption using a 13× molecular sieve can be used
to remove any trace quantities of 1-octanol from the distillate product of this recovery step.

This separation is more complicated for isoamyl alcohol as it hindered by: (1) a more
signiﬁcant azeotrope with formic acid at atmospheric conditions (89.2 mol% at 98.2 ◦C)
than 1-octanol and (2) a higher volatility than acetic acid. To ensure that TOA remains in
the diluent, the acetic acid can be back extracted into TMA/water along with the lactic
and levulinic acid. However, further puriﬁcation is then hindered by an acetic acid/water
azeotrope. To simplify this separation, the pre-extraction distillation step used in the 1-
octanol alternative was eliminated so that both acetic and formic acids were back extracted
to the TMA/water along with the other two acids. The ensuing azeotropes between these
acids and water can then be broken through extractive distillation using azelaic acid.
The economic cost of these two processes was measured by the NPV@20%, which
weighs the annual operating expenses and total capital investment over a 20-year life cycle
(Table 3). The primary economic difference between the two processes was the investment
required for the extractive distillation columns and their associated heat exchangers in the
isoamyl process. This resulted in an incremental NPV@20% of $6.5 million in favor of the
1-octanol process.

Screening and optimization experiments occurred in carboxylic acid solutions that did
not contain any calcium sulfate. The presence of calcium sulfate would decrease the acidity
of the solution, and in turn, decrease the equilibrium constant for ion-pair formation. To
account for these conditions, a cursory experiment was conducted to extract carboxylic
acids produced using the Sn-Beta in a CaSO4 solution (Table 4). Doing so signiﬁcantly
lowered the distribution coefﬁcients of all the target acids. The most signiﬁcant drop
occurred with lactic acid, which is likely due to a signiﬁcant increase in its formation from
the more favorable reaction conditions. The higher concentration coupled with lower
solution acidity worked to reduce the equilibrium of ion-pair formation with TOA.

Applying this to the design of the Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 processes, reactive
extraction with TOA/1-octanol was utilized in process area 04 with the distribution coefﬁ-
cients speciﬁed in Table 4. Within that area, both acetic and formic acids are separated from
the extract through distillation. The resulting acetic/formic acid distillate is then further
distilled to reach the respective product grades. The remaining TOA/1-octanol extract is
sent to process area 05 where lactic and levulinic acids are back extracted into TMA/water.
Both solvents are regenerated and lactic and levulinic puriﬁed through distillation in the
ﬁnal process area.

3.3. Capital Cost Estimates
An AACE category 4 factored broad estimate [22] of capital costs was conducted
based on equipment required for the process of pump size or larger. The condensed
estimated capital costs can be seen in Tables 5 and 6. These tables are condensed based on
unit classiﬁcation. The broadest of these classiﬁcations is process vessels which includes
distillation columns and trays, drums, and mixing vessels. Tables 5 and 6 also include the
additional investments required as a part of the total capital investment at a basis date
of January 2019. More detailed capital cost information can be seen in Tables S3 and S4
provided in Supplementary Materials.
Vendor estimates were obtained for compressors and rotary vacuum ﬁlters. Costs
for the remaining capital equipment were estimated utilizing cost charts published by
Ulrich [20]. These cost charts provided estimates at a basis date of 2004. To bring these
estimates to a January 2019 basis, CEPCI values of 400 and 616 were used for 2004 and
2019, respectively.
Equipment requirements for the two process alternatives were nearly identical. Any
differences were due to differences in product capacity due to the catalytic reaction yield.
A major sizing difference that occurred between the two alternatives was for the catalyst
calcination compressor due to increased hydrochar formation in the base Sn-Beta processes.
Additional mixers and settlers were required for the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process, since
lower efﬁciency in the reactive extraction step requires three additional extraction stages.
The ﬁxed capital investment was estimated at $120 million ± 40% for base Sn-Beta and
$130 million ± 40% for Sn-Beta + CaSO4.
Additional capital costs included working capital and the initial inventory of chemicals
and catalysts. As a rule of thumb, the working capital was estimated to be 15% of the
FCI. Costs were included for the initial inventories of 1-octanol, TOA, TMA, toluene,
Sn-Beta, 13× molecular sieves, and water. Vendor quotes were obtained for TOA, TMA
and 1-octanol, being valued at $8.49/kg, $2.64/kg, and $1.54/kg, respectively. Toluene
was estimated to be priced at $1.17/kg [40]. Water was priced as demineralized water
through Ulrich [20]. Based on the plant capacity for demineralized water, that price was
estimated to be $0.55 per 100 kg [20]. Sn-Beta and 13× molecular sieves were priced as
Silica/Alumina doped catalysts and zeolites in Ulrich, respectively [20]. Sn-Beta were then
priced as $12.30/kg and 13× molecular sieves as $10.80/kg. The capital costs for the initial
inventory of all chemicals and catalysts was valued at $2.1 million and $2.4 million for the
base Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 processes, respectively.
This slight difference is due to a higher acid product concentration in the Sn-Beta +
CaSO4 process, resulting in a larger solvent requirement. Adding in working capital and
the initial chemical and catalyst costs to the FCI, yielded a total capital investment (TCI) of
$140 million ± 40% for base Sn-Beta and $150 million ± 40% for Sn-Beta + CaSO4.

3.4. Operating Cost Estimates
Annual operating costs can be seen in Table 7. This table provides a breakdown
of the primary expenses that would be incurred for both process alternatives. Those
expenses include: raw material costs, makeup chemical and catalyst costs, operating labor
costs, maintenance costs, the costs for utilities and waste disposal, and other factors (R&amp;D
charges plus marketing and distribution charges). The average annual operating costs
were estimated at $79 million and $80 million for the base Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4
processes, respectively, on a January 2019 basis.

This process utilizes one raw material: corn stover. Corn stover prices are currently
around $64 per dry MT [21]. However, if corn stover were to be adopted as a commodity
chemical for agricultural processing, NREL expects the price to increase to $88 per dry
MT [21], which was the price used in this analysis. This cost is broken down to $38/MT
attributed to collection, milling, storing, and transportation to the plant and $50/MT as a
grower payment [1,21]. This results in a corn stover cost about $0.09/kg and an overall
raw material cost of $21 million per year for both process alternatives.
Consumable chemicals and catalysts used for by both processes include sulfuric acid,
calcium carbonate, cellulase enzymes, sodium hydroxide, and make-up amounts for the
reusable chemicals and catalysts purchased as part of the TCI. Prices of sulfuric acid and
calcium carbonate were estimated at spot prices of $0.33/kg and $0.11/kg, respectively. The
cellulase enzymes used for enzymatic hydrolysis were estimated to cost about $3.52/kg.
Sodium hydroxide was valued at $0.40/kg [40]. As a rule of thumb, all recycled chemicals
were assumed to experience a yearly depletion of 15% via losses and/or degradation.
These included 1-octanol, TOA, TMA, toluene and water, which were priced at $1.54/kg,
$8.49/kg, $2.64/kg, $1.17/kg and $0.25/m3, respectively. Similar to the chemicals being
recycled, catalysts and solid sorbents were assumed to have yearly losses of 5%. This
loss is applicable to both Sn-Beta and 13× molecular sieves at $12.30/kg and 10.80/kg,
respectively. Since the base material of both of these are zeolites, a total change out was
forecast to be required every four years. For the base Sn-Beta process alternative, the
total price for consumable chemicals and catalysts in a typical year was $4.5 million, with
$660,000 of that being spent on make-up materials each year. The Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process
alternative required $4.6 million in consumable chemicals a year with $700,000 required for
make-up. This difference is due to the increased solvent requirement for product extraction
in the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process.
Operating labor requirements were based on the number and type of unit operations
required for each process. Due to similar unit operation requirements, both processes were
estimated to require 90 operators split between 4.5 shifts to provide for 24/7 coverage.
A detailed explanation of this estimation can be found in Supplementary Materials. The
loaded pay rate for a plant operator in North Dakota of $33.30 per hour was used [27].
Using a 40 h work week basis, the labor cost of this project was estimated at $7.2 million
per year. This includes an extra 15% to account for supervisory wages.
Maintenance costs for both alternatives were estimated to be 4% of the FCI. This results
in a yearly cost of $5.1 million for the base Sn-Beta process alternative and $5.2 million for
the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process alternative.
Utility requirements were calculated based on the usage of cooling water, boiler-feed
water, process steam, and electricity throughout each process alternative. To minimize
energy consumption, energy generated in the system was recycled as generated steam
or heated water when possible. Additionally, all distillation columns were designed to
minimize condenser and reboiler duties while maintaining an operable number of trays
for the column. Unit costs of cooling water, boiler-feed water, and process steam were
calculated using equations from Ulrich [20]. Each utility equation is based on a combination
of the price of energy and capital requirements for utility production. Utility costs were
estimated using the Wahpeton, North Dakota industrial rates of electricity, $0.062/kWh [29],
and natural gas, $4.4/GJ [28]. The requirements of each utility can be found in Table 8
and sample cost calculations can be found in Supplementary Materials. Though used
throughout both process alternatives, low (148 ◦C, 450 kPa) and medium low (175 ◦C,
900 kPa) pressure steam is not included in this table. This is because an excess of the
two grades is produced through the vaporization of boiler-feed water used for cooling
applications in many of the heat exchangers.

Between the two process alternatives, the biggest difference in utility costs results
from differences in electricity requirements. This is due to higher hydrochar production
in the base Sn-Beta alternative. As a result, more compressed air is required for catalyst
calcination, leading to a larger compressor duty and subsequent higher use of compressor
motor power. An additional difference is that the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative requires
more than double the high-pressure steam than the base Sn-Beta alternative. This is
due to an increase in lactic acid, resulting in a higher reboiler duty for the TMA/water
recovery column. Since the reboiler operates higher than the condensation point of high-
pressure steam, the cooled utility is then used as medium-high-pressure steam, lowering
its production requirement. Overall, the annual utility requirements were estimated to be
$29 million for both process alternatives.
Black liquor wastewater produced through deacetylation needs to be treated before
it is released. To do so, the stream will be treated through ﬁltration and activated sludge.
The sludge will be used to remove the carbonaceous matter (acetate and lignin) extracted
from the corn stover. Based on the estimation equation from Ulrich [20] the processing of
120,000 kg/h of wastewater will be charged at a rate of $0.26/m3, totaling $280,000 per
year. Due to the calcium sulfate dissolved in the reaction solvent, this solvent is also treated
after the acid extraction step. Since both processes have calcium and sulfate concentrations
exceeding emission standards, and these salts are not biodegradable, tertiary treatment is
required [20]. For the base Sn-Beta process, 150,000 kg/h of water is estimated to require
treatment at a cost of around $990,000 per year. For the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process, part of
this solvent is recycled to the catalytic reactor, resulting in only 130,000 kg/h being treated
at $880,000 per year.
Other operating expenses include research and development, marketing and distri-
bution, and general administration. Research and development expenses were estimated
at 5% of the total operating expenses (including raw materials, chemicals and catalysts,
operating labor, maintenance, and utilities). This resulted in a cost of $3.4 million for
both process alternatives. Marketing and distribution fees were similarly calculated as
10% of the total operating expenses, resulting in $6.7 million and $6.8 million for base
Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternatives, respectively. General administration costs were
estimated to be 25% of the overhead. Overhead is deﬁned as 60% of the operating labor
and maintenance expenses. General administration was estimated as $1.8 million for the
base Sn-Beta alternative and $1.9 million for the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative.
3.5. Revenues
Revenues for both process alternatives (Table 9) were generated by the sale of the
produced organic acids and side-products as well as through recovered energy. Spot prices
were applied to all six saleable products. These include lactic acid at $1.48/kg, acetic acid
at $0.67/kg, formic acid at $0.68/kg, furfural at $1.65/kg, and gypsum at $0.04/kg [41–44].

Data obtained from a market study [43] indicated that the selling price for levulinic acid is
$7.08/kg with a maximum global market demand of 11,000 kg/year. Since both processes
would produce a signiﬁcant portion of the global demand, the selling price of levulinic
acid was reduced to $5.00/kg to match the anticipated ﬂooding of the market. Sales of
products are expected to produce $123 million and $191 million in annual revenue for the
Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4, respectively.

In addition to revenue from the products, two operating credits also generate signiﬁ-
cant revenue. The ﬁrst is the saturated water credit. This credit is available because both
process designs produce more low-pressure steam than is consumed in the process. To
avoid the production of useless steam, it was decided to use boiler-feed water rather than
cooling water to cool the process stream before furfural extraction and to then heat it to
just below its saturation point with the excess steam. The saturated water is then sent to
the utility boiler to produce the grades of steam that are not in excess. Heating the water
to its saturation point consumes about 21% of the energy required to make this steam.
This energy recovery saves $3.2 million and $3.5 million per year for the two respective
process alternatives in steam production costs and is represented as a revenue instead of
just reducing the steam utility costs.
The other credit is the lignin energy credit. After corn stover hydrolysis, a lignin-rich
stream is produced. Instead of disposing of the lignin, it is sent to the utility boiler to
generate heat in place of natural gas. By burning 5500 kg/h of lignin, over 110 GJ/h is
produced. Since natural gas costs $4.4/GJ, lignin energy generation saves about $4.2 million
per year for both process alternatives. Sample calculations for both of these operating
credits can be seen in Supplementary Materials. Including the credits, the total annual
revenue is $140 million and $200 million for the Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternatives,
respectively.
3.6. Overall Proﬁtability
Cash ﬂow sheets for the two process alternatives can be seen in Tables 10 and 11
and indicate the overall process proﬁtability of each. On the basis of a 20-year projected
operating life, the base Sn-Beta process alternative has an estimated NPV@20% = $3.3 mil-
lion ± 40%, while the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 process alternative is projected to be valued at an
NPV@20% = $110 million ± 40% at a January 2019 basis date. An NPV@20% greater than
$0 indicates that the process exceeds the minimum discounted rate of return of 20%.

The primary difference between the two alternatives is the amount of revenue gener-
ated annually. The Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative is estimated to produce $33 million/year
more in revenue than the base Sn-Beta alternative. This difference is directly related to
the efﬁciency of the Sn-Beta catalytic reaction, where the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 converts almost
twice as much carbon into saleable products than the base Sn-Beta (72% to 37%). This
difference is partially offset by the higher selling price of levulinic acid, though its annual
revenue is capped by a lower market demand.
3.7. Sensitivity Analysis
The largest source of economic variability for both processes is the gross margin. In
this case, the gross margin is deﬁned as the difference between the revenue generated
from products and the cost of the raw material. Based on product yields and spot prices
(speciﬁed in Section 3.6), the basis gross margin is $0.42 and $0.56 per kilogram of corn
stover processed for the base Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternatives, respectively.
For the base Sn-Beta case, the process would no longer be proﬁtable if the gross margin
decreased by 1% to $0.41/kg of corn stover. As seen in Figure 4, a 20% decrease in the gross
margin to $0.45/kg of corn stover would be required for the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative to
no longer be proﬁtable. Since both processes break even within the ±40% accuracy of the
economic analysis, the basis gross margin represents a relevant economic risk that should
be explored via a marketing study if either of these process pathways is developed further.

3.7. Sensitivity Analysis 
 The largest source of economic variability for both processes is the gross margin. In 
this case, the gross margin is defined as the difference between the revenue generated 
from products and the cost of the raw material. Based on product yields and spot prices 
(specified in section 3.6), the basis gross margin is USD 0.42 and USD 0.56 per kilogram of 
corn stover processed for the base Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternatives, respectively. 
For the base Sn-Beta case, the process would no longer be profitable if the gross margin 
decreased by 1% to USD 0.41/kg of corn stover. As seen in Figure 4, a 20% decrease in the 
gross margin to USD 0.45/kg of corn stover would be required for the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 
alternative to no longer be profitable. Since both processes break even within the ±40% 
accuracy of the economic analysis, the basis gross margin represents a relevant economic 
risk that should be explored via a marketing study if either of these process pathways is 
developed further. 
 
Figure 4. Sensitivity of NPV@20% to the gross margin for base Sn-Beta (triangles) and Sn-Beta + 
CaSO4 (solid circles) processes. Circled values indicate basis values, and the boxes indicate regions 
of most probable uncertainty, defined as ±40% of the basis gross margin. 
 The economic sensitivity of two other economic variables, fixed capital investment 
(FCI) and natural gas price (representing the cost for utility energy sources), were also 
evaluated for both processes. An increase in the FCI for the base Sn-Beta case by 3% from 
USD 124 million to USD 127 million results in a negative NPV@20%. However, for the Sn-
Beta + CaSO4 alternative, a 72% increase in the basis FCI, which is outside of the range of 
most probable uncertainty (40%), would be required for the process to no longer breake-
ven. The price of natural gas was varied as a reflection of utility production costs. A pos-
itive NPV@20% was estimated for the entire region of uncertainty for both process alter-
natives, indicating that utility costs are not an economic risk to this investment. 
4. Summary and Conclusions 
The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of catalytically transform-
ing corn stover-derived sugars into lactic acid or both lactic and levulinic acids as primary 
products. While previous studies on Sn-Beta-facilitated conversion have documented re-

4. Summary and Conclusions
The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of catalytically transforming
corn stover-derived sugars into lactic acid or both lactic and levulinic acids as primary
products. While previous studies on Sn-Beta-facilitated conversion have documented
reaction conditions, the economics of a process based on this technology has not been
previously evaluated. Two separate process alternatives were examined. We ﬁrst evaluated
the conversion of extracted sugars to carboxylic acids solely through the use of Sn-Beta.
This resulted in the co-production of lactic and levulinic acid as major products. The second
process included calcium sulfate as part of the reaction mixture, signiﬁcantly increasing the
reaction selectivity towards lactic acid. Both process alternatives produced other valuable
by-products that are worth purifying to a sellable grade, such as formic and acetic acid,
calcium sulfate, and furfural. Process plant throughput was determined by feeding the
corn stover equivalent to corn kernel feed in a typical bioethanol plant. This set the input
of both processes at 250,000 tons of corn stover per year.
Process separation steps utilized reactive extraction to remove carboxylic acids from
the reaction solutions. To deﬁne optimal conditions for the co-extraction of lactic, levulinic,
acetic, and formic acids, both screening and optimization experiments were conducted.
Based on the screening experiments, it was determined that the most signiﬁcant factors
are the aqueous/organic phase ratio, extractant concentration, acid composition, and
diluent type. Optimal conditions for both examined diluents, 1-octanol and isoamyl,
were determined using a central composite design. Based on these conditions, it was
determined that extraction with a 1-octanol diluent was more economical based on the
simpler downstream separation requirements.
It was found that both processes were proﬁtable with the base Sn-Beta design being
valued at an NPV@20% of $3.3 million while the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 design reached an
NPV@20% of $110 million. The lower proﬁtability of the base case is due to the lower
carbon conversion of carbohydrates to saleable carboxylic acid products. For the base case
to be more proﬁtable, levulinic acid would need to be sold at a price $5.39/kg higher than
that of lactic acid. The economics for both alternatives are sensitive to the gross proﬁt
margin, and the base case is also sensitive to the capital investment. Neither alternative
was sensitive to utility production costs.
A major hurdle for both processes is market demand for the levulinic acid co-product.
Though global demand for levulinic acid is expected to increase in the coming years, the
global demand in 2020 was expected to be only 7300 MTs with growth up to 11,000 by
2025 [43]. The base Sn-Beta alternative will produce 135% of the expected global demand
in 2025 and the Sn-Beta + CaSO4 alternative will meet 31% of the demand. For demand
to meet projected future production based on the technologies evaluated in this work,
advances in levulinic acid applications are needed. One potential application is to convert
levulinic acid into other intermediate chemicals with greater market demand [45].
