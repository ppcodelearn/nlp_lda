Abstract: Brazil’s large biofuels industry generates signiﬁcant amounts of efﬂuents, e.g., vinasse from
bioethanol, that can effectively be used as substrate for production of biogas via Anaerobic Digestion
(AD). The Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) is the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of methane
into ethylene, which is a main building block for the chemical industry. This work investigates
the potential and competitiveness of bio-ethylene production via OCM using biogas produced by
biological anaerobiosis of vinasse as a feedstock. The proposed process can add incentive to treat of
vinasse via AD and replace fossil ethylene, thus potentially reducing emissions of Greenhouse Gases
(GHG). A process model is developed in Aspen Plus v10 software and used to design an economic
Biogas-based Oxidative Coupling of Methane (Bio-OCM) process that consumes biogas and oxygen
as educts and produces ethylene, ethane, and light off-gases as products. Operating conditions in
the reaction section are optimized and a reaction product yield of 16.12% is reached by applying
two adiabatic Packed Bed Reactors (PBRs) in series. For the downstream CO2 removal section, a
standalone amine-absorption process is simulated and compared to a hybrid membrane-absorption
process on an economic basis. For the distillation section, two different conﬁgurations with and
without Recycle Split Vapor (RSV) are simulated and compared. The bio-ethylene production cost
for a Bio-OCM plant to be installed in Brazil is estimated considering a wide range of prices for
educts, utility, side products, and equipment within a Monte Carlo simulation. The resulting average
production cost of bio-ethylene is 0.53 ± 0.73 USD kg−1
C2H4. The production cost is highly sensitive
to the sales price assigned to a light off-gas side-product stream containing mostly the un-reacted
methane. A sales price close to that of Brazilian pipeline natural gas has been assumed based on the
characteristics of this stream. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that a bio-ethylene production cost
below or equal to 0.70 USD kg−1
C2H4 is achieved with a 55.2% conﬁdence, whereas market values for
fossil ethylene typically lie between 0.70 USD kg−1
C2H4 to 1.50 USD kg−1
C2H4. Technical and economic
challenges for the industrial implementation of the proposed Bio-OCM process are identiﬁed and
relevant opportunities for further research and improvement are discussed.

1. Introduction
The Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of biodegradable wastes is a bio-process in which the
organic matter in efﬂuents and residues is ultimately converted to methane (CH4) and
carbon dioxide (CO2). Biogas from AD typically contains 50% to 70% CH4, 30% to 50%
CO2, ≤1% N2, and 10 ppmv to 2000 ppmv H2S depending on the substrate and processing
conditions [1–3].
AD is commonly described by four major steps performed by microorganisms and
driven by thermodynamic principles: (i) hydrolysis, (ii) acidogenesis, (iii) acetogenesis
and (iv) methanogenesis. Since microorganisms are not able to assimilate particulate
organic matter, the ﬁrst stage in AD is the hydrolysis of complex particulate materials
into simpler dissolved materials, which can cross the cell walls of fermentative bacteria.
This conversion of particulate materials into dissolved materials is achieved through
the action of exoenzymes excreted by hydrolytic bacteria. Soluble products from the
hydrolysis phase are metabolized inside the cells of fermentative bacteria, being converted
into several simpler compounds, which are then excreted by the cells. The compounds
produced include: volatile fatty acids, alcohols, lactic acid, carbon dioxide, hydrogen
(H2), ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S), in addition to new bacterial cells.
As volatile fatty acids are the main product of fermentative organisms, they are usually
called acidogenic fermentative bacteria. Acetogenic bacteria are responsible for oxidizing
the products generated in the acidogenic phase into suitable substrates for methanogenic
microorganisms. The products generated in this process are H2, CO2, and acetate. The ﬁnal
step in the global process of anaerobic degradation, methanogenesis, is the conversion of
acetate into CH4 and CO2 by aceticlastic methanogens and of H2 and CO2 into CH4 by
hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
Biogas can be used for a number of purposes, including electricity production (most
common), heat generation and as raw material for industries [1–3]. Biogas production has
been a reality since the 1930s for the stabilization of sewage sludge. What has changed
over the years is that its production has been optimized and achieved at industrial scale
with a higher efﬁciency, degree of complexity and speciﬁcation, particularly in developed
countries. Biogas production can reduce emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), provide
a renewable source of energy and reduce impacts of pollution by waste disposal [4].
Furthermore, the activation of methane and/or carbon dioxide present in biogas enables
its chemical conversion into higher value biochemicals and biofuels [5].
One possible process for methane conversion into a valuable chemical is the Oxidative
Coupling of Methane (OCM), which is its heterogeneous catalytic oxidation into ethylene: a
major feedstock for chemical and polymer production. It is of scientiﬁc consensus that OCM
occurs via three steps (simpliﬁed): (i) activation of methane to methyl radical through
a C–H bond breaking and a hydrogen abstraction, (ii) homogeneous coupling of two
methyl radicals to ethane in the gas phase, and (iii) oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to
ethylene [6]. These steps are summarized in Equations (2) and (5). However, many parallel
side reactions also occur, which adds complexity to the downstream separations. The full
reaction network considered in this study, as proposed by [7], is given in Equations (1)–(10).
A trade-off between methane conversion and selectivity towards C2 products (ethane and
ethylene) is observed, which is typical of selective oxidation reactions.

OCM is not yet commercially applied, but the surge in shale gas exploration has
made it a potential route for producing valuable ethylene from cheap methane sources and
without wildly ﬂuctuating prices of crude oil [6]. A demonstration plant has been built
and put into operation by Siluria Technologies in Texas, U.S. [8].
In order for the ethylene production from biogas via OCM to be economically com-
petitive with the consolidated production from oil [9], a signiﬁcant amount of biogas
(process feed) is required to merely approach the economies of scale typical of this industry.
Consequentially, a great amount of a biodegradable efﬂuent (substrate) must be available
for AD. Agroindustry wastes such as whey (dairy industry efﬂuent), glycerin (biodiesel
production efﬂuent), and sugarcane stillage (also called vinasse, which is the sugar and
ethanol production efﬂuent) are all produced in large quantities worldwide and, due to
their high organic load, pose an environmental threat if not properly treated. Several stud-
ies have shown the feasibility of treating these efﬂuents by anaerobiosis with the associated
production of bio-energy, i.e., methane and/or hydrogen [10–17].
Among these efﬂuents, vinasse stands out as a particularly good candidate for large-
scale biogas generation. It is the main liquid stream from ﬁrst-generation ethanol pro-
duction process from sugarcane, beet, sweet sorghum, grape, corn, wheat, rice, cassava,
potato, and others [18]. Together, the U.S. and Brazil produced 85% of the world’s ethanol
in 2017. The vast majority of U.S. ethanol is produced from corn, while Brazil primarily
uses sugarcane [19].
Considering the Brazilian scenario, vinasse is derived from the ethanol distillation
step, leaving the columns at ≈360 K. The presence of melanoidins and the high organic
acid content gives it a dark-brownish color and low pH, respectively. Sugarcane processing
plants usually generate from 10 L to 15 L of vinasse per L of produced ethanol and, in 2019,
the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply estimated a production
of 31.6 × 109 L of ethanol [20,21]. This leads to an estimated 31.6 × 1010 L to 47.4 × 1010 L
of vinasse in this country alone in a single year. The vinasse is currently applied for
fertilization, but if not properly conditioned, vinasse may lead to pollution of soil and
water bodies. AD is an effective way to reduce its high organic load, i.e., COD, which
may reach values up to 65,000 mgO2 L−1, and make it suitable for use in fertilization while
simultaneously producing biogas [22].
The Southeast region of Brazil and, notably the state of São Paulo, concentrates a great
portion of the bioethanol production in the country. An interactive map has recently been
created by researchers at University of São Paulo containing the availability of organic
wastes (substrates), the biogas and biomethane production potential, as well as the available
infrastructure such as pipelines and compression stations [23]. The total estimated biogas
production potential lies at around 16.8 × 109 Nm3 year−1 (8.9 × 109 Nm3
CH4 year−1) with
Processes 2021, 9, 1613

around 88 % of the total stemming from vinasse AD [23]. Based on the yields obtained in the
present study (36.25 kgC2H4 kg−1
CH4), this could be used to produce around 900 kt of ethylene
per year and potentially replace some 9 Mt year−1 of oil (assuming 0.28 tC2H4 t−1
Naphtha and
0.35 tNaphtha t−1
Oil). This region is also very industrialized and hosts 42% of the total Brazilian
population [24], therefore also containing the infrastructure and market demand that are
required for a project such as this.
This contribution investigates the potential and competitiveness of industrial bio-
ethylene production via OCM using biogas produced by biological anaerobiosis of sug-
arcane vinasse as a feedstock. The main goals are to apply process simulation models to
conceptually design an economic Biogas-based Oxidative Coupling of Methane (Bio-OCM)
process using the structure depicted in Figure 1 and to assess its techno-economic feasibility.
A model of the OCM reaction section applying adiabatic Packed Bed Reactors (PBRs) is
used to maximize C2 product yield by manipulating the operating conditions. For the
CO2 removal section, a superstructure optimization is applied to determine whether to use
a standalone amine-absorption conﬁguration or a hybrid conﬁguration employing both
membrane and absorption. Two different process conﬁgurations are compared for the dis-
tillation section. The ﬁrst distillation conﬁguration only applies external low-temperature
refrigeration, while the second distillation conﬁguration adiabatically expands fractions
of the process streams to reduce external refrigeration consumption. Once the optimal
process design is deﬁned, the bio-ethylene production cost is estimated and compared to
typical market values for fossil ethylene. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to
encompass uncertainties in the cost estimations.

2. Materials and Methods
The process ﬂow diagram for the Bio-OCM process considered herein is depicted
in Figure 1. The process plant consumes biogas and oxygen as educts, while producing
ethylene as the main product and ethane and light off-gases as side-products. Biogas is
ﬁrst subjected to a regular treatment step for the removal of impurities such as H2S and
NH3. The CO2 removal step, i.e., biogas upgrade, is avoided and the CO2 present in biogas
serves to dilute the educts in the feed stream to the OCM reactor. This helps to contain the
intense reactions’ heat release. The treated biogas stream is fed to the OCM reactor together
with an oxygen stream. The hot reaction gases are cooled by generating High Pressure
Steam (HPS) and compressed prior to the CO2 removal section. CO2 removal is achieved
either by a hybrid permeation-absorption process or by a standalone amine-absorption
process. The ﬁnal hydrocarbon separation is achieved by distillation. The off-gas (lights)
Processes 2021, 9, 1613

stream containing mostly the unreacted methane is exploited energetically in a Combined
Heat and Power (CHP) unit. The process model focuses on the three main sections of the
proposed Bio-OCM process, i.e., reaction section, compression and CO2 removal section,
and distillation section, while the vinasse treatment by AD, the CHP, and the air separation
plants are not considered here.
In this study, the feed to the plant is assumed to be treated biogas and an oxygen-
rich stream (95 mol% O2 + 5 mol% N2) both at 313 K and 1.3 bar. The total inlet methane
ﬂowrate is speciﬁed at 15,000 Nm3
CH4 h−1, which can represent 50 mol% to 70 mol% of the
biogas composition with the rest being solely CO2. Such biogas production volumes can
only be achieved at large bioethanol plants, i.e., approximately 1,000,000 m3
Ethanol year−1
or by combining the output of two or more plants. A previous study on a medium-
sized bioethanol plant producing 1320 Nm3 h−1
CH4 revealed a rather insufﬁcient production
volume in order to achieve decent economies of scale and dilute investment in expensive
process equipment [5].
The main product is polymer-grade ethylene (0.9995 molC2H4 mol−1) and the resulting
plant output is 4632 tC2H4 year−1. The side products are a reﬁnery-grade ethane stream and
a methane-rich light off-gases stream. Both side streams are sold for additional revenue as
detailed in Section 2.4.6.
The models described in the following sections are implemented in the process simu-
lation software Aspen Plus and Aspen Custom Modeler v10. Further details on the models
are provided in [25] and the Aspen Plus model ﬁles are made available in [26]. All process
optimizations have been performed via a self-programmed Python interface to Aspen
Plus [27] and by applying Differential Evolution as optimization algorithm [28].
2.1. Reaction Section Model
The OCM reaction is carried out in adiabatic Packed Bed Reactors (PBRs) with oxygen
as the limiting reactant. Due to the high temperatures involved and high exothermicity
of the reaction network, supplying heat and controlling temperature are difﬁcult tasks.
Therefore, industrial operation with PBR in isothermal regime is unrealistic and adiabatic
regime is likely the only current option available with this reactor type [29]. To cope
with low per-pass product yields and high temperature rises, two reactors in series with
intermediate cooling and oxygen feed are adopted in this study.
The reactors are modeled using the Plug-Flow Reactor (PFR) model in Aspen Plus
(RPlug) with kinetics available in literature for La2O3/CaO catalyst [7]. The reactor model
implementation is validated by comparing simulation results to lab-scale isothermal exper-
iments by [7]. The comparison in terms of ethylene yield (deﬁned in Equation (11)) as a
function of the contact time (relation between amount of catalyst and gas ﬂow rate) for two
different temperatures is shown in Figure 2. The simulated and experimental results are
very comparable. The sharp bend occurring at 830 °C (1103 K) is due to oxygen extinction
in the reactor.

2.2. Carbon Dioxide Removal Section Model
Two competing process structures are considered for this section, i.e., a standalone
amine-absorption process and a hybrid process that applies both Gas Separation Mem-
branes (GSM) and amine absorption. Amine absorption is used in a wide variety of
industrial processes for CO2 removal. A common benchmark amine solution is Mo-
noethanolamine (IUPAC: 2-aminoethan-1-ol) (MEA), which is usually employed in aque-
ous solutions of up to 30 wt%. The solution reacts promptly with CO2 in the absorption
column, but its regeneration in a secondary desorption column consumes a signiﬁcant
amount of energy (up to 5.0 MJ kg−1
CO2) [30]. The hybrid process consists in applying GSM,
in this case polyimide polymeric membrane modules, to partially remove CO2 in the up-
stream of the absorption column. This reduces the required amount of recirculating amine
solution and, therefore the energy associated with its regeneration. However, the hybrid
process may potentially require additional compression to drive separation through the
membranes, higher capital investment in compressors, and lead to additional product
(ethylene) losses through the membranes. To deﬁne the optimal process structure and
operating conditions, a superstructure containing both alternatives is formulated to solve
an economic optimization problem.
2.2.1. Absorption Model
The process model of the Bio-OCM absorption section uses the Electrolyte Non-
Random Two-Liquid (eNRTL) activity model [31,32] and the Peng-Robinson (PR) Equation
of State (EoS) [33]. The columns are simulated using a conventional phase and chemical
equilibrium approach through Aspen Plus’ block RadFrac. The solubility of carbon dioxide
in an aqueous solution of 30 wt% MEA predicted by the model is compared to experimental
data by [34] in Figure 3. A very good agreement can be observed within the relevant range
of process conditions.

The solubility of hydrocarbon gases in aqueous amine solutions is usually higher
than that in pure water, which several authors refer to as salting-in effect [35]. Therefore,
the parameters used to calculate the Henry constant of all gases in water and in MEA have
been ﬁtted to experimental data.
2.2.2. Gas Separation Membranes (GSM) Model
For this application, ﬂat-sheet envelope-type membrane modules developed at
Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht are considered [36]. Among the previously tested mem-
brane materials, a polyimide-based membrane has been selected for its high CO2 selectivity
towards several hydrocarbons [37]. For this speciﬁc application, selectivity is relatively
more important than permeability, since ethylene is a valuable product and losses must
be kept at minimum even if this implies large membrane areas. Since the membrane is
selective for CO2, its concentration increases in the permeate stream and reduces in the
retentate stream.
For GSM, a previously published one-dimensional solution-diffusion model has been
used [37]. The component’s ﬂux through the membrane is calculated as the product of the
permeance and the driving force. The ﬁrst is ﬁtted to mini-plant experimental data [38],
and the second is given by the difference in the component’s fugacity on each side of the
membrane calculated by the PR-EoS. The resulting Differential Algebraic Equation System
(DAEs) is discretized by orthogonal collocation on ﬁnite elements, implemented in the
software Aspen Custom Modeler, and exported as a custom unit operation into Aspen Plus.
2.3. Distillation Model
The ﬁnal separation section contemplates two distillation columns, namely
de-methanizer, which is responsible for recovering the light components (CH4, H2, CO,
N2), and C2-splitter, which is responsible for C2H4 and C2H6 separation. Two different
designs are compared on an economic basis for this section. The ﬁrst one is herein called
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
8 of 30
traditional conﬁguration because it has been previously adopted by several authors [39–41].
The traditional conﬁguration uses only external refrigeration cycles to generate the cold
utility required to condense the columns’ top products. The petrochemical and natu-
ral gas processing industries, however, usually employ different schemes that expand
a fraction of the hydrocarbon feed or products to produce “in-process” cold utility and
reduce the load of external refrigeration cycles. To assess the potential of applying such
schemes within a Bio-OCM process, a functional Recycle Split Vapor (RSV) distillation
conﬁguration is developed taking patent [42] as a basis and compared to the traditional
distillation conﬁguration.
The columns are modeled using Aspen Plus’ RadFrac block under phase-equilibrium
assumption. The PR-EoS with its original mixing rule and full set of binary parameters has
been used to model this part of the process [33]. In both columns, constraints (design-specs
in Aspen Plus) are used to achieve target purities and recoveries by manipulating input
variables such as the reﬂux and boil-up ratios. In the demethanizer bottoms, methane
contamination is set to (1 × 10−4 molCH4 mol−1), while ethylene recovery is set to 99%.
In the top of the C2-splitter, ethylene recovery is set to 99% while its purity is set to achieve
polymer-grade, i.e., 0.9995 molC2H4 mol−1.
2.4. Cost Models
This section describes the cost models used to estimate variable costs (educts, side-
products, and utilities) as well as ﬁxed cost (equipment).
2.4.1. Total Annualized Cost
The total annualized cost per mass of product (bio-ethylene), i.e., TACC2H4 in
USD kg−1
C2H4, is given by Equation (12). The TACC2H4 encompasses the utility cost and
annualized equipment cost, while also considering product losses by placing the ethylene
output mass ﬂow in the denominator. The TACC2H4 is used in the process design stage as
the objective function to be minimized within a process optimization problem or as the
criteria to compare alternative process conﬁgurations. Throughout this study, a plant’s
operating life (N) of 30 years and an interest rate (iR) of 10% have been used.

2.4.2. Ethylene Production Cost
For the economic evaluations described in Item Section 4, the total production cost of
bio-ethylene, i.e., cC2H4 in USD kg−1
C2H4, is calculated as per Equation (13). Besides utility cost
and annualized equipment cost, the cC2H4 also includes the cost of educts and revenues from
side products. This is then divided by the output mass ﬂow rate of ethylene. The equipment
cost is annualized by the same formula as in Equation (12).
cC2H4 =
˙cUtility + ˙cAnnualizedEquipment + ˙cEducts − ˙cSideProducts

The calculated production cost for bio-ethylene (cC2H4) is then compared to typical mar-
ket values for fossil ethylene, which can range from 0.70 USD kg−1
C2H4 to 1.50 USD kg−1
C2H4
and ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly with the oil price [43]. For the plant to be constructed, several
other costs such as civil engineering, land and terrain, instrumentation and automation,
electric engineering, operation and maintenance, taxes, depreciation, contingency, etc.,
would also incur. Environmental costs are also not taken into account in this economic
calculations. Therefore, the bio-ethylene production cost calculated by Equation (13) must
be signiﬁcantly lower than ethylene’s market value to justify the economic potential for a
Bio-OCM plant. The calculation of the individual components of Equation (13) are detailed
in the following sub-sections.
Processes 2021, 9, 1613

2.4.3. Monte Carlo Simulation
There is a large degree of uncertainty in all terms of Equation (13). In some cases,
even small variations can signiﬁcantly alter the outcome of the analysis. To deal with
this, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed. Reasonable cost ranges, i.e., bounds, are
given to each one of the cost components contained in Equation (13). The bio-ethylene
production cost is then computed 10,000 times with random values between bounds being
assigned for each cost component. This allows for a statistical interpretation of the results.
For instance, one can compute in how many of these 10,000 samples the bio-ethylene
production cost results lower than a target value, i.e., the probability that the bio-ethylene
production cost is below a target value. The following Sections 2.4.4–2.4.6 discuss, for each
term of Equation (13), the considered ranges/bounds for each variable in the Monte Carlo
simulation. The randomize function of Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel has been used to generate
the random values for the Monte Carlo sampling.
2.4.4. Utility Cost
The Bio-OCM consumes electricity and Light Pressure Steam (LPS) and Medium
Pressure Steam (MPS) for heating, while exporting High Pressure Steam (HPS) produced by
using the reactions’ heat release. The electricity cost for small-medium enterprises in Brazil,
which is around 0.126 USD kWh−1 (35 USD GJ−1) [44], is adopted. This is additionally
employed to modify the cost of low, medium, and high-pressure steam from their default
values in Aspen Plus. The conditions and cost for all applied utilities are summarized in
Table 1. For the Monte Carlo simulation, the ranges are set to ±30% of the nominal values
in Table 1.

2.4.5. Equipment Cost
Sizing and costing of equipment is performed using activated economics in Aspen
Plus, which essentially transfers simulation data into Aspen Process Economic Analyzer
(APEA) software. APEA contains automated procedures for equipment sizing and costing
based on an updated data-bank. In Item Section 4.3, a location factor of 1.4 is applied to
correct the installed equipment cost estimated by APEA, as suggested in other studies for
chemical plants based in Brazil [45].
Cost estimations in conceptual and basic engineering are typically assumed to have
a ±30–50% error margin. Given the difﬁculties in estimating cost for royalties to be paid,
notably for the reactor and catalyst technologies, a range of −30% to +50% is considered in
the Monte Carlo simulation as a simple and conservative solution.
2.4.6. Cost of Educts and Side Products
Biogas
The cost for producing biogas depends on a handful of parameters such as the sub-
strate, transportation, plant capacity, and the amount and nature of contaminants. A general
study reports ranges of 0.03 USD Nm−3 to 0.05 USD Nm−3 [46]. Speciﬁcally for biogas de-
rived from vinasse AD, estimates in the range of 0.022 USD Nm−3 to 0.038 USD Nm−3 [47]
and 0.0525 USD Nm−3 [48] have been identiﬁed. For the Monte Carlo simulation, the entire
range of 0.022 USD Nm−3 to 0.0525 USD Nm−3 has been adopted.

Oxygen
Oxygen is assumed to be provided by an adjacent air separation unit, which is not
included in the model. Oxygen-rich streams can be obtained industrially from air via
cryogenic distillation or Pressure-Swing Adsorption (PSA). Since a high oxygen purity it not
required for this application, a 95 mol% oxygen stream is assumed with the contamination
consisting only of inert nitrogen. For the subsequent Monte Carlo simulation, the assumed
oxygen delivery price range is 0.04 USD kg−1
O2 to 0.10 USD kg−1
O2 [49].
Ethane
Ethane is considered to be sold as a side-product with a price in the range of
0.0467 USD kg−1
C2H6 to 0.0686 USD kg−1
C2H6 based on [43].
Light Off-Gas
The main side product of the Bio-OCM plant is a light gas stream, which con-
tains mostly the un-reacted CH4 (≈90 mol%) along with minor amounts of H2, CO, N2,
and trace amounts of C2H4 and C2H6. A sales price close to that of pipeline natural
gas in Brazil, which ranges from 5.00 USD GJ−1
HHV to 6.91 USD GJ−1
HHV [44,45], is assumed.
For the subsequent Monte Carlo simulation, a sales price range between 2.0 USD GJ−1
HHV to
5.0 USD GJ−1
HHV is assigned to the light off-gas stream. Natural gas speciﬁcation in Brazil is
given by a resolution or standard ANP No. 16-2008 by the National Agency for Petroleum,
Natural Gas and Biofuels. Table 2 compares the speciﬁcation of pipeline natural gas in
Brazil with those of the lights stream resulting from this simulation study. As it can be seen,
the lights stream almost matches the required speciﬁcations for pipeline-quality natural
gas from the standard ANP 16-2008, thus justifying a similar sales price. For additional
reference, characteristics of other conventional and unconventional gaseous fuels are re-
ported. These are based on data from [50], which include biogas from sewage sludge and
gas obtained from catalytic pyrolysis of high-density poly-(ethylene), i.e., PPG.

3. Process Design Results
This section provides results regarding the selected process structure and operating
conditions. The full set of material and energy balances for the ﬂowsheets is provided
in [25].
3.1. Reaction Section Design
The simulation ﬂowsheet for the reaction section of the Bio-OCM process is shown on
Figure 4. The biogas feed is simulated by mixing a pure CH4 stream named CH4 and a
pure CO2 stream named CO2. This is done to investigate the effect of different inlet CO2
concentrations to the reaction performance. The biogas stream is mixed with the 95 mol%
O2 stream named O2-1 in mixer MIX-1 and passes through two pre-heating exchangers
E-01 and E-02 reaching the feed temperature for the ﬁrst reactor R-01. The furnace blocks
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
11 of 30
F-01 and F-02 are required for start-up only and the system is auto-thermal in steady-state.
The product gas of R-01 is cooled in a heat exchanger E-03 by generating HPS, mixed with
a second O2 stream named O2-2, and further cooled in E-01 to the feed temperature of the
second reactor R-02. The product gas of R-02 is again cooled in a heat-exchanger E-04 by
generating HPS and further heat is recovered in E-02.

The process conditions are determined by means of a mathematical optimization
targeting the maximization of the combined ethylene and ethane yield (C2 yield) as given by
Equation (14). The decision variables are the feed temperatures to each reactor, the amount
of CO2 fed via the stream named CO2, the amounts of O2 fed via streams named O2-1
and O2-2, and the amount of catalyst, i.e., contact time, in each reactor. The resulting C2
yield is 16.12%, while methane conversion is 24.9% and selectivity towards C2 products
is 64.7%. The relatively low conversion means that a signiﬁcant amount of CH4 is still
available in the reaction product gas. The resulting C2H4 to C2H6 ratio is 1.5, thus a
signiﬁcant amount of ethane is also produced as side product. The obtained performance
is not exhilarating. In fact, C2 yields as high as 24.2% have been previously obtained in a
mini-plant set-up with packed-bed membrane reactors [51]. However, the results are well
in line with current scientiﬁc publications and patents that also adopt adiabatic operation
with PBR [29,42]. Thus, it provides a realistic performance in terms of what could be
achieved on an industrial-scale implementation to date.

The optimal amount of CO2 in the biogas feed is close to its upper limit, which
implies a biogas feed with approximately 50 mol% CO2. Therefore, there is no need for
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
12 of 30
an upstream CO2 removal step as the CO2 dilution has a positive effect to the reaction
performance. The inlet O2 ﬂow rates lead to methane to oxygen ratios of 8.4 molCH4 mol−1
O2
and 10.0 molCH4 mol−1
O2 in R-01 and R-02, respectively. These are signiﬁcantly higher than
the stoichiometric ratio of 2 molCH4 mol−1
O2 , but this is expected for adiabatic operation as
high oxygen availability leads to undesired combustion reactions coupled with strong
heat release.
The optimal feed temperatures are 1020 K and 1015 K for R-01 and R-02, respectively.
These are high inlet temperatures as adiabatic operation also leads to a high temperature
rise along the reactors. As temperatures can reach above 1273 K, a reactor with a refractory
lining is required and thermal stability of the catalyst may become an issue for long-term
operation. Low-temperature OCM catalysts that are active below 973 K offer great potential
to simplify operation and achieve higher yields in adiabatic operation, but these are still
new and underdeveloped [52]. In this sense, there is an urge to re-evaluate the performance
of several OCM catalysts in adiabatic regime, given that this remains the best alternative
for industrial implementation [29]. Speciﬁcally for biogas or any CO2-diluted process feed,
it is also essential that future studies investigate the inﬂuence of CO2 on the reaction and
catalyst on an experimental level and also revise current kinetic models so that they cover
this range of operating conditions. Therefore, there are still technical challenges that need
to be addressed prior to industrial implementation.
The reaction section produces HPS as its only utility, which is exported to generate
a revenue (negative cost) of 605,638 USD year−1. Figure 5 shows the total equipment cost
estimated at 2.25 × 106 USD divided into equipment categories. The equipment cost is quite
balanced between heat exchangers, furnaces, and the reactors, which are tubular carbon-
steel vessels with refractory lining. Additional incurring costs, e.g., royalties for catalyst
and reactor technology, are not estimated but assumed to be covered by the conservative
−30% to +50% equipment cost range used in the Monte Carlo simulation later in Item
Section 4.5.

3.2. Carbon Dioxide Removal Section Design
The simulation ﬂowsheet containing the superstructure for the CO2 removal section
is given in Figure 6. A splitter block (SPL-202) and a by-pass stream (M-BYPASS) allow for
the simulation of both conﬁgurations, i.e., standalone absorption and hybrid membrane-
absorption. The product gas from the reaction section is fed to a direct contact cooler
or quench column (C-201), in counter-current with a recirculating cooling water stream.
The cooled gas stream is compressed in one or two stages (K-201 and K-202) with inter-stage
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
13 of 30
water cooling (E-201 and E-202) and condensate removal drums (D-201 and D-202). If the
membrane section is used, the gas is dried (X-201), further compresssed (K-301), cooled
(E-307), and fed to the ﬁrst membrane module (M-301). The CO2-rich permeate stream
may be purged (SPL-301) or re-compressed (K-302) and forwarded to a second membrane
module (M-302) in order to enhance ethylene recovery. The retentate stream from M-301
feeds three absorption stages in series (C-301, C-302, and C-303) counter-current to the
recirculated MEA solution. The latter is distributed to the three stages at different ratios via
a splitter block (SPL-302) and the bottom of each absorption stage may be cooled to shift
the chemical equilibrium towards absorption. The rich or loaded amine solution is ﬂashed
to near atmospheric pressure (D-301), pressurized (P-301), cooled by heat-recovery (E-304),
and enters the desorption or amine regeneration column (C-304). Amine regeneration is
accomplished by MPS, producing a nearly pure CO2 stream (CO2-OUT) at the top and
a lean amine stream at the bottom. The lean amine stream is again pressurized (P-302),
heated by heat-recovery (E-304), and enters the mixer (MIX-302). A make-up stream
is added to MIX-302 to replenish evaporative losses of amine and water in the process.
The output of MIX-302 is cooled to 45 °C (318 K) and generates the recycle stream to the
absorption (LEAN-IN). The CO2-free top product stream of C-303 is further cooled, passes
through a knock-out drum (D-303), is dried (X-301), compressed (K-303, K-304, and K-305),
and forwarded to the distillation section (TO-DIST). A 97% removal of the inlet CO2 is
ﬁxed and ensured by manipulating the amine re-circulation ﬂow rate via the tear-stream
LEAN-IN. The ﬁnal CO2 removal must be performed by a caustic wash, which has not
been included in the model for simplicity.
The process structure or conﬁguration and operating conditions for the CO2 removal
section are determined by a superstructure optimization targeting the minimization of
the total annualized cost per mass of ethylene output, i.e., TACC2H4 as given in Item
Section 2.4.1. The main decision is whether to use a standalone absorption conﬁguration
or a hybrid membrane-absorption conﬁguration, but the full set of 13 decision variables
include the pressure ratios in compressors K-201, K-202, K-203, K-303, and K-304 given in
bar bar−1; the membrane areas in membrane modules M-301 and M-302 given in m2; the
split fractions in splitters SPL-202, SPL-301, SPL-302; the lean loading for the recirculating
amine solution given in molCO2 mol−1
MEA; and the number of stages and feed stage in C-304.
The discharge pressure in K-305 is ﬁxed at 30 bar, which is the required pressure for the
downstream distillation.
The optimal process conﬁguration is found to be standalone absorption at low pres-
sure (3.13 bar). These are the conditions shown in Figure 6. For comparison purposes,
a second optimization is run by enforcing the use of GSM, i.e., the hybrid membrane-
absorption conﬁguration. The comparison, in terms of utility cost rate per utility category
and equipment cost per equipment category are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
The use of GSM can reduce the speciﬁc amine regeneration energy from 3.04 MJ kg−1
CO2
down to 2.50 MJ kg−1
CO2, which leads to a reduced cost rate for MPS. However, the steam
cost savings are unjustiﬁed as the most signiﬁcant contributions to the TACC2H4 actually
stem from electricity cost rate and investment cost for compressors. The use of GSM
requires additional compression in the upstream (K-201, K-202, and K-301) to provide
enough driving force for permeation-based separation, which increases electricity cost rate
and compressor equipment cost. On the other hand, standalone absorption can be carried
out at lower pressures, which means that the downstream compressors (K-303, K-304,
and K-305) take up the majority of the compression duty after CO2 has been removed and
the total gas ﬂow rate to be compressed is signiﬁcantly lower. Because of these, the hybrid
membrane-absorption conﬁguration has a 6.8% higher utility cost rate and a 17.7% higher
equipment cost.

The product (ethylene) loss is also an important factor for computing the TACC2H4.
Ethylene losses resulting from the simulations are 2.1% for the standalone absorption
conﬁguration and 7.3% for the hybrid conﬁguration. This is because GSM present a lower
C2H4 selectivity towards CO2 than amine-absorption. In the hybrid conﬁguration, some
ethylene is purged out of the system in splitter SPL-301. In this conﬁguration, it is possible
to increase ethylene recovery by increasing the membrane feed pressure and/or by using a
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
16 of 30
higher recycle to M-302. However, both of these options lead to increased electricity cost
rates and additional investment in process compressors. The adopted low pressure for
the standalone absorption conﬁguration also minimizes ethylene losses by reducing its
physical absorption by the MEA solution.
Overall, the standalone absorption conﬁguration outperforms the hybrid conﬁgura-
tion regarding utility cost, equipment cost, and product recovery. The obtained TACC2H4
are 1.00 USD kg−1
C2H4 and 1.15 USD kg−1
C2H4 for the standalone absorption and hybrid conﬁg-
urations, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of GSM is unlikely to
bring any signiﬁcant cost-savings to the Bio-OCM process.
3.3. Distillation Section Design
Figure 9 depicts the simulation ﬂowsheet of the traditional distillation conﬁguration.
In this conﬁguration, refrigeration ﬂuids produced externally are applied in the condensers
of both demethanizer and C2-splitter columns. Due to the very low temperatures required
in the top of the demethanizer column (≈173 K), a 3-stage refrigeration cascade employing
methane (R-50), ethylene (R-1150), and propylene (R-1270) is required. This refrigeration
system is included as a sub-ﬂowsheet (HIERARCHY block in Aspen Plus), which is
represented by the squared block named REF in Figure 9 and fully shown in Figure 10.
Methane at −110 °C (163 K) is employed in the demethanizer condenser, whereas ethylene
at −60 °C (213 K) is employed in the C2-Splitter condenser.
The simulation ﬂowsheet for the RSV distillation conﬁguration is shown in Figure 11.
The feed gas for the distillation section is assumed to be free of CO2, dry, and delivered at
3.13 bar and 318 K. The gas is initially compressed (K-401, K-402, K-403) to 30 bar and is pre-
cooled in a multi-stream plate-ﬁn heat-exchanger (MHX1), i.e., cold-box. The pre-cooled gas
stream is ﬂashed and fed to the demethanizer (C-401). The top product is splitted into two
fractions. The stream TO-EXP is expanded (EXP-401), used as cold utility in both MHX2
and MHX1, and generates the off-gas side-product stream (LIGHTS). The stream TO-COMP
can optionally be further compressed (K-405), but this compressor is by-passed in the ﬁnal
design to save capital expenditure. Stream S18 is partially condensed in MHX2, then ﬂashed
(D-403) to generate the demethanizer’s reﬂux stream (C1-REFLX). The demethanizer’s
bottom stream (C2+) feeds the C2-splitter (C-402) after being ﬂashed to 8.7 bar to increase
ethylene and ethane relative volatility without signiﬁcantly lowering the mixture’s dew
point. Ethane is removed as the bottom product (C2-BOT) of the C2-splitter. The stream
coming at the top (C2-TOP) is heated-up in MHX3, compressed (K-404A), and splitted
(C2-SPL). The stream TO-MHX3 is cooled down (MHX3), partially condensed in the C2-
splitter’s reboiler (C-402REB), and generates the C2-splitter’s reﬂux stream (C2-REFLX).
The stream S7 is further compressed (K-404B and K404C) and generates the main ethylene
product stream (C2H4).
This conﬁguration still requires external refrigeration utility. A refrigeration cascade
applying only two stages with ethylene (R-1150) and propylene (R-1270) can be used
and energy consumption is reduced signiﬁcantly. In the RSV conﬁguration, external
refrigeration is only provided for pre-cooling (MHX1) by propylene at 227 K (−46 °C)
and ethylene at 188 K (−85 °C). In Figure 11, this is again represented by a squared
HIERARCHY block named REF, which contains the external refrigeration system sub-
ﬂowsheet shown in detail in Figure 12. In some cases, a single streams heaters and
a single-stream cooler with opposite heat duties are employed to simulate two-stream
heat-exchangers, i.e., MHX1-C2 and MHX1-C3 simulate MHX1 (cold-box in Figure 11),
while E-504A and E-504B simulate the ethylene condenser/propylene evaporator. For cost
calculations, only one heat-exchanger is considered.

Figure 13 shows the resulting cost rates for the different utilities employed in the
traditional and RSV distillation conﬁgurations divided into different categories. All utility
(electricity, steam, and cooling water) required to run the external refrigeration systems are
grouped into the refrigeration utility category. The proposed RSV distillation conﬁguration
leads to a slightly higher process electricity cost rate, but can drastically reduce the refrigera-
tion utility cost rate. The refrigeration utility cost rate is, in both cases, comprised mostly of
electricity to run the refrigeration compressors. This conﬁgurations enables a better match
of heating and cooling loads. The lowest temperature cooling duty at the demethanizer
condenser is realized by the expanded demethanizer top stream (in-process generated
utility), while the higher temperature cooling duty, i.e., feed pre-cooling, is realized by
external refrigeration. In the traditional scheme, the opposite occurs. Overall, the newly
developed RSV distillation conﬁguration allows for an approximate 31% reduction in the
total utility cost rate, i.e., 1.1 × 106 USD year−1 vs. 1.6 × 106 USD year−1.
Figure 14 details the cost of different equipment installed in the traditional and RSV
distillation conﬁfugrations. All equipmment (compressors, heat exchangers, and drums)
present in the external refrigeration systems are grouped into the Refrigeration category.
The proposed RSV distillation conﬁguration requires slightly higher investments in process
compressors and heat exchangers, but allows for a signiﬁcant reduction in refrigeration
equipment cost. The refrigeration equipment cost is, in both cases, comprised mostly
of investment cost for compressors. The cost saving is achieved mostly because the RSV
conﬁguration removes the R-50 (methane) refrigeration compressor and the lowest tempera-
ture R-1150 (ethylene) refrigeration compressor. These are both necessary costly equipment
in the traditional conﬁguration (K-501 and K-502A in Figure 10). In total, the equipment
costs are 13.8 × 106 USD and 11.6 × 106 USD for the traditional and RSV distillation conﬁg-
urations, respectively, so that a 16% equipment cost reduction has been achieved.

In practice, the RSV distillation conﬁguration may present additional challenges not
addressed in this study, such as a more complex process control structure, longer start-
up times, and less operational ﬂexibility. However, it becomes clear that applying this
conﬁguration can lead to signiﬁcant reduction in the ethylene production cost. By applying
Equation (12), the computed TACC2H4 are 0.661 USD kg−1
C2H4 and 0.503 USD kg−1
C2H4 for the
traditional and RSV distillation conﬁgurations, respectively. Thus, a 24% cost reduction
is achieved.
4. Economic Evaluation
The optimal process conﬁguration for the Bio-OCM plant led to a reaction section
employing two adiabatically operated PBR in series, an amine-based standalone absorption
process to remove carbon dioxide, and a low-temperature hydrocarbon distillation process
applying a RSV conﬁguration to reduce refrigeration cost. The Bio-OCM plant consumes
biogas and oxygen as the main educts. The main product is bio-ethylene, while ethane and
light gases are also obtained as side-products. In terms of utilities, electricity as well as low
and medium pressure steam are consumed, while high pressure steam is exported.
4.1. Cost of Educts and Side Products
Table 3 summarizes all educts and products of the Bio-OCM process in terms of ﬂow
rates, assumed price ranges, and resulting cash ﬂow rates. The yearly cash ﬂows are
the products of the ﬂow rates of each educt/product and their respective price ranges.
Worst-case cash ﬂows occur with educt cost at upper limit and side-product prices at lower
limits, respectively. In the best-case scenario, the contrary occurs. In the average scenario,
the arithmetic mean between lower and upper bounds are taken for reference.

In terms of educt cash ﬂows, biogas has the highest share. Since adiabatic reaction
operation requires high methane to oxygen ratios, only a small amount of oxygen is
consumed. Reducing biogas production cost, e.g., by improving its generation via AD or
its treatment step, can yield more signiﬁcant cost savings to the process.
The obtained ethylene to ethane ratio in the reactor is 1.5, so a signiﬁcant production
of ethane is achieved. However, revenue from ethane sales has a very limited contribution
to the total cash ﬂow due to its low sales price. Recycling ethane back to the Bio-OCM
reactor could improve ethylene production and lead to additional revenue, but it is likely
to reduce overall process selectivity as both C2 products are readily oxidized into CO2.
A potentially good alternative is the addition of Ethane Dehydrogenation (EDH) thermal
or catalytic reactor that can selectively convert ethane into ethylene and hydrogen. This
is not evaluated further to avoid over-extending this study, but should be considered in
future analyses.
The lights stream is found to be the most sensitive component of the total cash ﬂow.
Since methane conversion in the reaction is low, a signiﬁcant amount of methane is exported
in this side-product stream. In fact, the entire process concept can also be seen as a biogas
upgrade plant producing ethylene as a side product. Therefore, the total cash ﬂow is
highly sensitive to the price adopted for the lights stream. For the nominal and best-case
scenarios, a positive cash ﬂow is obtained even without bio-ethylene sale revenues. For the
worst-case scenario, however, the cash ﬂow is negative, thus increasing the production cost
of bio-ethylene.
Recycling the lights stream back to the OCM reactor is undesired because it also con-
tains H2, CO, and N2. Treating this stream to recycle only the methane portion is possible,
but energy-intensive. Another alternative is the use of a methanation (Sabatier) reactor,
within which CO and H2 from the lights stream and CO2 from the absorption separation
section are converted into more methane. Finally, this stream could also be reformed
with carbon dioxide, e.g., methane dry reforming, for the side production of synthesis gas.
These alternatives could be considered in future techno-economic evaluations as alternative
pathways for valorizing the lights off-gas stream.
4.2. Utility Cost
Table 4 provides the total utility cost rates for each utility category and for each
section of the Bio-OCM process. Electricity consumption, which incurs mostly from gas
compression, represents the major source of utility cost. Refrigeration cost is also indirectly
comprised mostly of electricity to run refrigeration compressors. Altogether, these two
categories amount to nearly 62% of the total utility cost rate. Therefore, the adopted RSV
distillation conﬁguration offers great economic beneﬁt to the process by providing cost
savings in the most critical utility category.
Medium Pressure Steam (MPS) represents the second most expensive utility category.
MPS is used solely in the amine regeneration step, which makes this the single most
expensive step in the entire process representing 52% of the total utility cost rate. This
is due to the large amount of CO2 that enters the process with the biogas. This study
considered the use of a benchmark 30 wt% MEA solution, which reacts extremely fast with
Processes 2021, 9, 1613
24 of 30
CO2, but requires signiﬁcant regeneration energy. In this sense, switching to another amine
solution could potentially lead to signiﬁcant cost savings.
Regarding the different process sections, the CO2 removal represents the highest share
of utility cost rate. Besides MPS for amine regeneration, this section also consumes a
signiﬁcant amount of electricity to compress the gas from 1.3 bar to 3.13 bar as well as
cooling water to run the condenser of the regeneration column, the other amine coolers,
as well as the inter-stage cooling of the gas compressors. The distillation section consumes
mostly electricity to run the process and refrigeration compressors, whereas the reaction
section is able to export HPS to generate additional revenue.

4.3. Equipment Cost
Table 5 details the cost of the different equipment types installed in each process
section. Compressors represent the most expensive equipment category closely followed
by refrigeration equipment, which also mostly consists of refrigeration compressors. Al-
together, these two categories represent 56% of the total capital investment in equipment.
The third largest category is heat exchangers, followed by columns, drums, and then by
minor contributions of furnaces, reactors, and pumps.
Among the different process sections, distillation is presents the highest capital invest-
ment, accounting for 61% of the installed equipment cost. This is mainly because of process
gas and refrigeration compressors. It is followed by the CO2 removal section, and ﬁnally
by the reaction section.

The OCM reactors are assumed to be carbon steel vessels with a refractory lining and
packed with the catalyst as described in recent patents [42]. While the reactor by itself
is not a mechanically complex and expensive equipment to manufacture, there would
be additional charges to cover the cost of technological development, e.g., in the form of
royalties. This uncertainty is assumed to be accounted for in the Monte Carlo simulation,
wherein the equipment cost is varied between −30% and +50% as discussed in Section 2.4.5.

4.4. Bio-Ethylene Production Cost
The total bio-ethylene product output is 4632 tC2H4 year−1. Based on the cost estima-
tions obtained in Sections 4.1–4.3, the production cost per mass of bio-ethylene is calculated
using Equation (13). The estimated values and ranges of each cost components are used
to compute a nominal as well as a worst and a best-case scenarios. These are reported in
Table 6.

Table 6 clariﬁes that a wide range of results are possible and that the main source of
uncertainty relates to the cost of educts and and price of side-products. More speciﬁcally,
the most sensitive parameter is the cost assigned to the lights stream, which depends on
the cost of natural gas in Brazil. In the best-case scenario, wherein the light stream is sold
at 5.0 USD GJ−1
HHV, the revenue from side products is high enough to completely cover all
expenses, resulting in a negative bio-ethylene production cost. In this scenario, bio-ethylene
revenue would generate a bonus. In the worst-case scenario, however, the lights stream is
sold at 2.0 USD GJ−1
HHV and the resulting production cost for bio-ethylene is above typical
market values for fossil ethylene. The nominal case results in a production cost below
market value.
Table 6 also highlights a well-distributed share between utility and equipment cost.
Scaling-up the system would typically lead to a further beneﬁcial dilution of the equipment
cost due to economies of scale, but this obviously difﬁcult since biogas production facilities
tend to be rather distributed. Therefore, large-scale bio-ethanol plants generating signiﬁcant
amounts of biogas through vinasse AD are the best candidates for this type of project.
The ethylene production capacity is, however, still tiny compared to typical fossil-based
naphtha or ethane steam cracking plants.
4.5. Monte Carlo Simulation
The Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 samples resulted in a production cost of
0.53 ± 0.73 USD kg−1
C2H4. The average bio-ethylene production cost is, therefore below
typical market values for fossil ethylene. However, the standard deviation clariﬁes again
how wide the range of outcomes is.
The cumulative distribution for the bio-ethylene production cost resulting from the
Monte Carlo simulation is given in Figure 15. The line shows in how many of the Monte
Carlo samples (percent-wise) the calculated bio-ethylene production is less or equal to
the values given in the x axis. It can be understood as the conﬁdence that the production
cost is less or equal to the given value. For instance, a bio-ethylene production costs
lower than fossil ethylene’s lowest market value of 0.70 USD kg−1
C2H4 is achievable with a
55.2% conﬁdence, whereas a production cost lower than ethylene’s highest market value of
1.50 USD kg−1
C2H4 can be achieved with 87.0% conﬁdence. For conﬁdence levels higher than
95%, the bio-ethylene production cost is way above the market value. Overall, it becomes
clear the bio-ethylene cannot provide an economic alternative to fossil ethylene with a high
degree of conﬁdence.

4.6. Discussion
Brazil produces ethylene mainly from steam cracking of naphtha. Even though the
country has recently become a net oil exporter [53], it imports light oil for petrochemical
production (≈113 million Barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) in 2012) given that internal
production consists mostly (≈70%) of heavy oil that cannot be processed effectively in the
domestic reﬁnery park [54]. Hence, production cost of fossil ethylene in the country is
speculated to be on the higher end of the spectrum.
Brazil also hosts a 200 kt year−1 bio-ethylene plant, which is obtained by catalytic dehy-
drogenation of bio-ethanol [55]. It is estimated that the cost of bio-ethylene production from
ﬁrst generation bio-ethanol in Brazil is in the range of 1.13 USD kg−1
C2H4 to 1.17 USD kg−1
C2H4
(considering the average December of 2019 exchange rate of 1.11 USD EUR−1) [55], which
is in accordance with the cost range estimated in this work. The manufacturer, i.e., Braskem,
uses it to make polyethylene sold under a seal denominated “I am green”. The products
holding this seal must have their bio-based carbon content determined via radiocarbon
analysis (ASTM D6866) [56]. It is unclear, yet highly possible, that customers would accept
paying a higher price for a certiﬁed bio-based polyethylene containing the seal. This type
of certiﬁcation and market strategy could also enable bio-ethylene produced via Bio-OCM
to reach higher market values.
The depletion of resources and introduction of restrictive measures such as carbon
taxation is also likely to gradually raise the price for fossil commodities, including ethy-
lene and natural gas, in short-to-medium term. Fully replacing fossil-based ethylene by
biogas-based ethylene is unthinkable due to the limited production volumes achievable.
Bio-OCM can, however, similarly to catalytic bioethanol dehydration, act as a bridge tech-
nology. It immediately allows for the use of a renewable feedstock to produce traditional
platform chemicals with established processing and transportation infrastructure until the
production of new bio-based platform chemicals is fully developed and scaled-up.
This study also highlighted the importance of the lights stream as a side-product for
the overall economic viability of the process. Several OCM researchers are trying to improve
yield of C2 products via new catalysts and novel reactor concepts, e.g., chemical looping [57].
However, industrial implementation of such technologies only seem feasible in the medium-
to-long term future, while developing multi-product systems that efﬁciently integrate
OCM can offer signiﬁcant potential for industrial deployment today. Future studies
Processes 2021, 9, 1613

should, thus focus in making the most out of the off-gas stream, e.g., via methanation and
methane dry reforming. A combination of these process routes would be a solution to
increase ﬂexibility in the production of bio-ethylene, bio-syngas, and bio-energy based on
ﬂuctuating market conditions.
The vinasse efﬂuent is currently employed within the agricultural sector for soil and
water amendment in a technique called fertigation. However, if its high organic load is
not properly treated prior to this, signiﬁcant GHG (particularly methane) emissions incur.
Providing alternative pathways for monetizing biogas produced through vinasse AD adds
incentive for its treatment and for emission reductions. Based on the yields obtained in
this study and the biogas production potential of the state of São Paulo, Brazil [23], it has
been estimated that ethylene produced through Bio-OCM could replace as much as 900 kt
of fossil ethylene yearly in this state alone. This could potentially also lead to signiﬁcant
environmental beneﬁts, which are best addressed through more holistic studies, i.e., Life
Cycle Assessment.
5. Conclusions and Outlook
This contribution designs a process and investigates the economic potential of bio-
ethylene production via Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) contained in biogas derived
from the Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of vinasse efﬂuent from bioethanol reﬁneries in Brazil.
The optimized process structure consists in a reaction section employing Packed Bed Reac-
tors (PBRs) in adiabatic regime, a CO2 removal section employing amine-absorption, and a
distillation section employing a Recycle Split Vapor (RSV) conﬁguration. A C2 reaction
product yield of 16.12% is achieved in the simulations by optimizing process conditions.
However, technical challenges regarding long-term catalyst and operation stability under
the high temperature and CO2 dilution involved still need to be addressed, and the po-
tential use of low-temperature catalysts should be considered in future studies aiming at
industrial implementation. The proposed hybrid membrane-absorption conﬁguration for
the CO2 removal section is found to be uneconomical. The proposed RSV distillation conﬁg-
uration, on the other hand, provides a 24% lower total annualized cost than the traditional
distillation conﬁguration and, thus, has a great potential to be employed industrially.
The bio-ethylene production cost is estimated under a wide range of possible costs
for educts, products, utilities, and equipment by means of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The resulting average production cost of bio-ethylene is 0.53 ± 0.73 USD kg−1
C2H4 and is
lower than typical ethylene market values. The bio-ethylene production cost is very
sensitive towards the price assigned to the lights stream as a side-product, which in this
study is based on the natural gas price. Under the assumed range of price scenarios, a bio-
ethylene production cost under 0.70 USD kg−1
C2H4 is only achieved with a 55.2% probability
and in those cases where natural gas, ethylene, and/or electricity prices are high. Further
research should focus on reducing the uncertainty on the price assigned to the lights stream
as well as investigating different process integration options to exploit this stream.
