4,"Abstract: The traditional two-column reactive distillation (RD) process is used for the production
of butyric anhydride, which is synthesized with butyric acid and acetic anhydride via a reversible
reaction.
In this work, a novel process with a single RD column (SRDC) is designed for the
production of butyric anhydride, where the second distillation column for separating excess reactant
is removed based on the boiling point proﬁle of the reaction system. Two applications of the proposed
SRDC process, namely SRDC with excess butyric acid or acetic anhydride circulating internally, are
economically optimized, and the results show that both SRDC processes have a lower total annual
cost (TAC) than the traditional two-column process. Furthermore, from the perspective of TAC,
the application with an excess feed of butyric acid is better than the application with excess acetic
anhydride. The developed technique may also be applied to retroﬁt other traditional two-column RD
processes, where the overhead and bottom products are the lightest and heaviest components of the
reaction system, respectively, and no azeotrope is involved in the RD column."

6,1. Introduction
7,"Butyric anhydride is an important intermediate product, which is mainly used in the production
of cellulose acetate butyrate, butyl butyryl lactate, and spices. The existing production of butyric
anhydride is a reversible anhydride exchange reaction of butyric acid and acetic anhydride. The
boiling point proﬁle of the reaction systems shows that reactive distillation (RD) can be used to produce
butyric anhydride. RD is an intensiﬁed process which couples the chemical reaction with distillation
separation in one piece of equipment, thus equipment costs are reduced. RD can also improve the
conversion and yield of the reversible reaction by removing the product from the reaction system in
time; in addition, the concentration of reactants increases and the reaction rate also increases as the
products are moved out. In the past decades, the batch RD process has been used to produce butyric
anhydride [1], with the purity of butyric anhydride being high. The main disadvantages of the batch
process include diﬃculty of operation, long production period, high labor costs due to the diﬃculty of
automation, and high energy consumption due to the need to steam out the transition components [1].
In recent years, continuous manufacturing processes have been introduced to produce ﬁne
chemicals, such as butyric anhydride, due to the numerous advantages over batch-wise manufacturing;
these include lower capital and operating costs, improved controllability and product consistency, and
lower environmental footprint [2–4]."

12,"Gao [1] introduced continuous RD technology for producing butyric anhydride based on the
analysis of the physical properties of the reaction system; results revealed that the continuous RD
process is feasible for the production of butyric anhydride."
13,"The operation of the continuous RD process can be classiﬁed into two types, namely, neat and
excess. For neat operation, reactants are fed into the RD column at the same ratio as the stoichiometric
of reaction, while the composition of the column overhead and bottom products are not determined
in this situation, since strict ﬂow control cannot be guaranteed in practical production; for example,
Xu et al. [5] compared the neat and excess operations for synthesizing N-propyl propionate, the
dynamic simulation results show that the product purity requirements cannot be ensured during neat
operation; Daniel et al. [6] showed the same result with a process combining a continuous stirred tank
reactor and an RD column for production of isoamyl acetate on a pilot scale."
14,"Therefore, the excess operation is often adopted in practice; this requires one feed for the reactants
according to the reaction stoichiometric, which helps avoid the disadvantage of the neat operation,
while an additional distillation column is needed to separate the excess reactant from the product.
Chung et al. [7] studied the inﬂuence of the excess ratio on the reactant conversion and energy
consumption, and the results show that there is an inherent trade-oﬀ between the number of reactive
trays and energy consumption; Chua et al. [8] compared diﬀerent choices of excess reactant for
producing isopropanol with the RD process."
15,"As a result of the reliability of the excess operation, Li et al. [9] proposed a two-column RD process
to produce butyric anhydride with an excess feed of butyric acid, thus the reliability of the process was
validated by simulation and experiments."
16,"In this paper, a novel continuous process with a single RD column (SRDC) is proposed to produce
butyric anhydride using the excess operation, where the second distillation column in the traditional
RD process for separating excess reactant is removed based on the analysis of the boiling point proﬁle
of the reaction system. In order to ensure the stable composition of the RD column, an excess reactant
is usually needed in the traditional RD process, and for this reason a second distillation column is
needed to separate the product from the excess reactant. SRDC completes the separation of the excess
reactant and the product in the stripping section or the rectifying section of the RD column. Compared
with the traditional RD process, product puriﬁcation is removed and the total annual cost (TAC) of
butyric anhydride production is greatly reduced."
17,"The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the reaction kinetics and
thermodynamic data needed for the simulation of the RD process. The traditional two-column RD
process for the production of butyric anhydride is simulated in Section 3. Section 4 analyzes the
boiling point proﬁle of the reaction system and presents a novel SRDC process with internal material
circulation for butyric anhydride production, where two diﬀerent applications are simulated and
compared. Finally the paper is concluded in Section 5."
18,2. Reaction System
19,2.1. Synthesis of Butyric Anhydride
20,"The reaction of acetic acid with butyric anhydride is homogeneous; it is also a series of reversible
reactions without a catalyst, which is carried out in two steps as shown by Equations (1) and (2). The
reaction rates of the two steps are quite diﬀerent, and the rate of Reaction (1) is much greater than that
of the second step. According to Li et al. [10], the most suitable reaction temperature is 343.15 K."

107,3. Simulation of Two-Column RD Process for the Production of Butyric Anhydride
108,"According to the above reaction kinetic and thermodynamic data, and the process introduced in
the literature [9], the traditional two-column RD process is operated with a 10% excess feed of butyric
acid as simulated with Aspen Plus, where the pressure of both columns is 20 kPa, and the residence
time of reactive tray is 6 min. Figure 1 shows the process parameters and simulation results of the
process streams, where NF means feed position; Nr, Nrxn and Ns represent the number of rectifying,
reactive, stripping trays, respectively; and NT means the total number of column trays. The reactants
are fed into the RD column C1; the overhead discharge of C1 is acetic acid, while the bottom discharge
is the mixture of excess butyric acid and butyric anhydride, which is fed into distillation column C2,
whose overhead discharge is the excess butyric acid to be recycled back to C1, and the bottom discharge
is the product butyric anhydride, whose purity is more than 94 mol %, as seen from Figure 1."
109,Figure 1. Traditional two-column reactive distillation (RD) process.
110,4. Single RD Column with Internal Material Circulation
111,4.1. Principle and Two Applications
112,"Before the reactants are fed, it is supposed that the excess operation has been used to prepare the
initial bottom materials of the RD column before start-up, e.g., the mole ratio of acetic anhydride to"
113,"Processes 2020, 8, 1"
114,5 of 10
115,"butyric acid is 1.1:2 for the bottom materials. The neat operation is used for the RD column after the
process is running in a steady state. As a result of the diﬀerent boiling points of the pre-excessed acetic
anhydride reactant and the acetic acid, they can be separated easily from in the rectifying section of
the column. As shown by Figure 2a, the acetic anhydride is always excessive and circulates in the
column, thus the conversion of butyric acid is very promising, similar to the case of the traditional
two-column RD process with the excess feed of acetic anhydride. Of course, the condenser duty of the
RD column in Figure 2a must be tuned carefully to implement the internal circulation of the excessed
acetic anhydride."
116,"Figure 2. A single RD column (SRDC) with internal circulating excess reactant. (a) SRDC with internal
circulation of pre-excess AcAn; (b) SRDC with internal circulation of pre-excess BuAc."
117,"Similarly, with an excess of butyric acid in the initial bottom material, the internal circulation of
butyric acid can also be realized by tuning the reboiler duty of the RD column in Figure 2b carefully,
since the diﬀerence in boiling points is also signiﬁcant between butyric acid and butyric anhydride.
The above two applications of the single RD column with excess reactant circulating internally are"
118,the bases of the proposed SRDC process.
119,4.2. Simulation of the SRDC Process
120,"The application of internal circulation of excess reactant depends on tuning the condenser duty or
reboiler duty of the SRDC. Therefore, it is important to simulate the processes shown in Figure 2a,b
whose corresponding ﬂowsheets in ASPEN are shown with Figure 3a,b. The position of the reactive
section is ﬁxed, but the simulation strategy is diﬀerent depending on the diﬀerent excess feed. When
acetic anhydride is in excess, the rectifying section and the reactive section are separated from the
stripping section, the tear ﬂow is supplemented with an excess of 10% acetic anhydride, and the
rectifying section is used to separate the excess acetic anhydride and acetic acid. When butyric acid is
in excess, the rectifying section is separated from the reactive section and the stripping section, the
tear ﬂow is supplemented with an excess of 10% butyric acid, and the stripping section is used for the
separation of the excess butyric acid and butyric anhydride."
121,"In Figure 3a, which represents the pre-excess of acetic anhydride, the upper column with the
condenser is the only rectifying section of the SRDC, as shown in Figure 2a; the only material discharged
from overhead is the acetic acid byproduct, the excess acetic anhydride circulates internally, while the"
122,"Processes 2020, 8, 1"

124,"lower column with the reboiler only includes the reactive and stripping sections of the SRDC, whose
bottom discharge is the butyric anhydride product."
125,"Figure 3. Flowsheets of SRDC with internal circulation of excess reactant. (a) SRDC with internal
circulation of pre-excess AcAn; (b) SRDC with internal circulation of pre-excess BuAc."
126,"In Figure 3b, which represents the pre-excess of butyric acid, the upper column with the condenser
only includes the reaction and rectifying sections of the SRDC, as shown in Figure 2b, whose overhead
discharge is also the acetic acid byproduct; while the lower column with the reboiler only represents the
stripping section of the SRDC, where the pre-excess butyric acid is separated from butyric anhydride
and circulates internally; the bottom discharge is also the butyric anhydride product."
127,4.3. Simulation Results of the Optimized SRDC
128,"On the basis of the ﬂowsheets presented in Figure 3, sensitivity-based optimization was carried
out to optimize the proposed two applications of the SRDC process, and the results are shown in
the following."
129,"Under the condition of a pre-excess of acetic anhydride, the simulation results of the optimized
SRDC process are shown in Figure 4, the SRDC3 is the SRDC with excess acetic anhydride
circulating internally."

164,4.4. Economic Comparison
165,"In this section, the traditional two-column process with an excess of butyric acid and the proposed
two applications of the SRDC process are compared from the perspective of TAC, the calculation
of which is shown in Equation (13) [12], consisting of capital cost and energy cost. The capital cost
includes the cost of the column, tray, and heat exchanger, and the energy cost includes the cost of steam
and cooling water. As shown in Table 4, the TAC of the three processes are calculated and compared."
166,TAC = capital cost/payback period + energy cost
167,(13)
168,"As seen in Table 4, both SRDC processes are more economical than the traditional two-column
process. In addition, the excess of butyric acid is more economical than the excess of acetic anhydride
for the SRDC process; this condition is the result of the removal of the second distillation column,"
