9,"Abstract: Biomass gasification is an attractive technology and one of the pathways for producing
hydrogen. Due to the variable seasons and low calorific value of biomass, the addition of coal in the
gasifier is suggested because coal has a high calorific value and carbon-to-hydrogen ratio. In general, the
gaseous product obtained in gasification always contains a high amount of carbon dioxide, therefore, the
co-gasification of biomass and coal should integrate with the calcium looping carbon dioxide capture
process to provide purified hydrogen. In this work, the model of the co-gasification of biomass and
coal integrated with the calcium looping carbon dioxide capture process was developed through an
Aspen Plus simulator. The developed model was used to analyze the performance of this process. The
sensitivity analysis demonstrated that increasing the gasification temperature, steam-to-feed (S/F) ratio,
calcium oxide-to-feed (CaO/F) ratio, and regenerator temperature could improve hydrogen production.
Next, further optimization was performed to identify the optimal operating condition that maximizes
hydrogen production. The results showed that the optimal operating temperature of the gasifier is
700 ◦C with an S/F mass ratio of 2 and coal to biomass (C/B) mass ratio of 0.75:0.25. However, the
carbonator and regenerator temperatures should be 450 ◦C and 950 ◦C, respectively, with a CaO/F mass
ratio of 3. Under these operating conditions, the maximum H2 content and H2 yield can be provided as
99.59%vol. (dry basis) and 92.38 g hydrogen/kg biomass feeding. The other results revealed that the
energy efficiency and carbon capture efficiency of this process are 42.86% and 99.99%, respectively, and
that the specific emission of released CO2 is 80.77 g CO2/MJ.",0

12,"Nowadays, conventional power generation based on fossil fuels encounters several
problems, including the depletion of fossil fuel resources and CO2 emissions as a green-
house gas. To solve these problems, many researchers have tried to develop alternative
renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Hydrogen in particular is often perceived
as an energy carrier for the future since it is a clean, efﬁcient, renewable, and non-polluting
energy source with a high energy density (33.3 kW h/kg) [1]. This makes it a promising
source of renewable energy that could address the global energy crisis while also meeting
environmental concerns [2]. Nowadays, hydrogen can be used as fuel for mobile and
stationary applications through fuel cells or internal engines without carbon emissions [3],
however, it should be derived from renewable resources, e.g., biomass [4], ethanol [5,6],
and biodiesel [7], to support a sustainable energy system.",0
13,"Biomass, as an agricultural residue, is an alternative renewable energy source since it
is abundant, readily available, and inexpensive. The main advantage of biomass is CO2",0

22,"neutrality, which is a balance between CO2 emission from the production process and CO2
adsorption by the plant. In general, biomass is widely used for energy and heat production
through the combustion process [8]. In addition, the conversion of biomass into fuels,
chemicals, or gaseous products has received signiﬁcant attention since the energy storage
in this product form is easy to store, transport, and handle.",0
23,"The selection of methods to produce a chemical product from biomass depends on the
desired product. This research focuses on hydrogen production from biomass and thus,
the gasiﬁcation process is recommended. Although the product obtained from biomass
gasiﬁcation is synthesis gas or syngas, hydrogen can be further produced through various
puriﬁcation processes. At present, the investigation of the gasiﬁcation process has received
more attention in both the experiment and process simulation. Syngas production through
the gasiﬁcation process is affected by both the operating conditions of the gasiﬁer and
gasifying agent types. Arteaga-Pérez et al. [9] studied the gasiﬁcation of sugarcane bagasse
in a bubbling ﬂuidized bed gasiﬁer through simulation with the Aspen Plus simulator.
They reported that under the condition of 750 ◦C with an equivalent ratio of 0.3, the total
exergy efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency are the highest. The gasifying agent fed to react
with the biomass has an effect on both the composition and heating values of the syngas.
Fernandez-Lopez et al. [10] investigated the gasiﬁcation of animal wastes in a dual ﬂuidized
bed gasiﬁer by using the Aspen Plus simulator. At different ratios, two types of gasifying
agents, i.e., steam and CO2, were studied. The result indicated that the use of steam as a
gasifying agent can produce a higher H2/CO ratio than that of CO2. Shen et al. [11] studied
the CO2 gasiﬁcation of woody biomass in a lab-scale auto-thermal gasiﬁer. Their result
showed that the CO composition increased while CH4 decreased because of the Boudouard
reaction; carbon conversion and cold gas efﬁciency (CGE) increased with the CO2 addition.
Although biomass is renewable and available, its amounts may ﬂuctuate depending
on agriculture, season, cultivated area, and volume of agricultural production. Therefore,
biomass power plants cannot operate in some seasons. In addition, the use of biomass has
some obstacles to operation since it has a high moisture content, low bulk density, and low
caloriﬁc value, which have an impact on hydrogen production [12]. In order to resolve the
utilization of biomass, there are many researchers focusing on the co-gasiﬁcation of biomass
and coal [13–15]. Not only is coal cheap, easily transportable, and abundant in resources, but
coal gasiﬁcation has a high efﬁciency in hydrogen production. In addition, coal has a high
energy caloriﬁc value because the thermodynamic efﬁciency of coal is higher than biomass.
Shahabuddin and Bhattacharya [16] assessed the co-gasiﬁcation of coal and biomass with a
CO2 agent by using the Aspen Plus process simulator. They reported that the blending of
coal and biomass in an equal amount can provide a higher lower heating value (LHV) and
CGE than pure coal by 12% and 18%, respectively. Biomass blending of up to 50% favors
gasiﬁcation performance with an LHV of 12 MJ/kg and a CGE of 78%. Howaniec et al. [17]
determined the reactivity of coal, biomass, and fuel blends in a laboratory-scale ﬁxed bed
reactor which was operated at 700, 800, and 900 ◦C. Their results showed that the reactivity
of fuel blends of coal and biomass had the highest value compared to coal and biomass char
reactivity at the same operating conditions. Secer et al. [18] implemented response surface
methodology (RSM) to determine the optimal operating conditions of the hydrothermal
co-gasiﬁcation of sorghum at a constant temperature of 500 ◦C for maximum hydrogen
content. Their results showed that the highest total gas and hydrogen volumes could be
obtained under conditions where the higher levels of the water volume of the reactor and
lower levels of the coal percentage of the coal/biomass mixture were combined.",0
24,"In general, the syngas product derived from gasiﬁcation is composed of H2, CO, CO2,
and CH4. However, to enhance the H2 yield in the syngas product, CO and CO2 must be
removed. Calcium looping is the most promising technology for the CO2 capture process
and offers many beneﬁts [19]. Calcium oxide (CaO) is cheap and widely distributed; as
a sorbent, it can save operation costs and be environmentally friendly [20,21]. When the
syngas obtained from the gasiﬁcation process is delivered to the calcium looping process,
the CO2 in the syngas will adsorb on the surface of CaO where the carbonation reaction as",0
25,"Energies 2023, 16, 2728",0
26,3 of 17,0
27,"an exothermic reaction can occur (referred to as carbonator), and thus, calcium carbonate
(CaCO3) can be generated. Since CO2 is produced from the water gas shift reaction while
the CO2 is removed from the carbonation reaction, it is possible to perform the separation
of CO2 simultaneously during the water gas shift reaction in a single unit. When CO2
is produced from the water gas shift reaction, it will be adsorbed into CaO through the
carbonation reaction. Thus, the CO2 removal causes a shift in the equilibrium of the water
gas shift reaction to the product side. The occurrence of the two following reactions: the
water gas shift and carbonation reactions in a single reactor, which is referred to as the
sorption-enhanced water-gas shift (SE-WGS) reaction, can reduce not only CO2 but also CO.
After the carbonation reaction is complete, CaCO3 is sent to the regenerator reactor where
CaCO3 can be desorbed to CO2 and CaO. Since the reaction occurring in the regenerator
(called the calcination reaction) is an endothermic reaction, a high external heat source is
required. A number of works have focused on the SE-WGS reaction with wider types of
sorbents [21–23]; for example, Wang et al. [21] revealed that Ni-doped CaO (Ni-CaO) could
promote a SE-WGS reaction.",0
28,"Most of the previous publications focusing on gasiﬁcation integrated with the calcium
looping process have performed a sensitivity analysis of operating conditions. However,
optimization should be performed to determine the global optimal operating condition
of gasiﬁcation and calcium looping that can provide the maximum H2 product. In this
research, the statistical method is introduced to discover the important parameters that
inﬂuence process efﬁciency. In addition to performance analysis and optimization, an
environmental assessment in terms of carbon emission should be considered to ensure that
the proposed system has no negative effect on the environment.",0
29,"This research aims to study hydrogen production from the co-gasiﬁcation of biomass
and coal integrated with the calcium looping process through the Aspen Plus simulator
version 10. Firstly, the effect of operating conditions in gasiﬁcation (i.e., gasiﬁcation tem-
perature, steam to feed ratio, and coal to biomass mass ratio) and the calcium looping
process (i.e., carbonator temperature, regeneration temperature, and CaO to feed mass ratio)
on hydrogen production is investigated. Next, the optimization of the gasiﬁcation and
calcium looping process is performed by using Design Expert 11 where the maximum H2
production is the main objective function. Finally, the energy analysis and carbon dioxide
emission-to-energy consumption of the co-gasiﬁcation of biomass and coal integrated with
the calcium looping process is determined.",0

31,"Figure 1 presents a schematic diagram of the integrated co-gasiﬁcation with calcium
looping process designed in the Aspen Plus simulator. The black line represents the material
stream, whereas the blue and red lines demonstrate the water or steam and energy streams.
In this research, the mixture of pellet pine wood and lignite coal is selected as the raw
material for hydrogen production. The process is divided into two sections that include
(1) the gasiﬁcation process and (2) the puriﬁcation of H2 from raw syngas through the
calcium looping process. Firstly, biomass (BIOMASS) and coal (COAL) are separately fed
into a dryer (DRY), which is modeled by the Sep model to remove moisture from the biomass
and coal. Next, the dried biomass (BIO-1) and dried coal (BIO-2) are separately supplied
to the decomposition reactor (DECOM) which is represented by the RYield reactor model.
In the Aspen Plus simulation, both the biomass and coal are deﬁned as non-conventional
components. They must be decomposed into conventional components which include the
conventional elements: C, H, N, O, S, etc. The components of biomass and coal are deﬁned
based on proximate and ultimate data, as shown in Table 1. Next, the outlet product
from each decomposition reactor (BIO-3 for biomass and BIO-4 for coal) is mixed and
delivered to a gasiﬁer (GASIFIER) corresponding with steam (STEAM). The gasiﬁer, which
is modeled by the RGibbs reactor model, can calculate the gas composition at the chemical
equilibrium through the minimization of the Gibbs free energy method. The type of gasiﬁer
reactor used in this study is a ﬂuidized bed gasiﬁer. Although the RGibbs reactor model",1

through a cooler (COOL) before feeding into the calcium looping process (ADSORBER)

through a water gas shift reaction (Equation (5)). CO2 is produced from the water gas
shift reaction and the gasiﬁcation process is captured by CaO (MIXCAO) as a sorbent
through the carbonation reaction (Equation (8)). When CO2 is removed from the syngas,
the H2 yield in the syngas product is higher. Next, the puriﬁed H2 is separated from the
CaCO3 and other contaminants through a gas-solid separator (SEP-1). Then, the CaCO3 is
sent to the regenerator reactor (DESORP) which is modeled by the RGibbs reactor model.
When the CaCO3 desorbs CO2 it is converted back into CaO through a calcination reaction
(Equation (9)). Some regenerated CaO is deactivated from the regenerator and accumulated
in the system. Therefore, it is necessary to split out CaO, recycle it to mix with makeup
CaO, and then send it to the carbonator reactor.",1

et al. [27] studied the conversion of rice husk into syngas. Rice husk with a proximate and
ultimate analysis, as listed in Table 1, was fed at 1 kg/h into a fluidized bed gasifier at 750 ◦C
and 1.05 bar. The comparison between the simulated results and experimental data, as seen in
Figure 2, indicates that the model underpredicts the experimental values for CO and CH4 and
overpredicts the value of H2 and CO2, but the trend of changing the compositions with the
steam-to-biomass ratio agrees with the experimental data. Minutillo et al. [28] experimented
with a downdraft gasifier at a temperature of 900 ◦C and an air-to-pellet pine wood ratio of
1.96. The result, as shown in Figure 2, indicated that the model is in good agreement with the
experimental data. However, the amount of CH4 obtained from the experiment is higher than
that from the simulation. This is due to the fact that the calculation is performed based on
the equilibrium while the experimental test may not be progressed to chemical equilibrium.
Nevertheless, the obtained results are consistent with the literature [13]. Finally, the simulation
result is validated for the coal gasification process with experimental data extracted from

adsorber (i.e., CaO/F mass ratio, carbonator temperature, and regenerator temperature) on
hydrogen production are investigated. In the second part, the DOE method is applied to
identify the optimal operating condition of both processes that can provide the maximum
H2 amount; the response parameters considered are the H2 mole fraction. Next, the energy
analysis is performed to determine the useful energy obtained from this process. Lastly, the
environmental assessment is studied to predict the carbon dioxide emission.",0

5.1.1. Effect of Gasiﬁcation Temperature on H2 Production
Figure 3 shows the effect of gasiﬁcation temperature on compositions of H2, CO, CO2,
and CH4 (dry basis). The gasiﬁcation temperature is varied in a range of 500–1000 ◦C,
whereas the S/F mass ratio of 1 and pressure of 1 atm are ﬁxed as a constant value. It is
noted that the mass ﬂow rates of biomass and coal are equal to 1000 kg/h. As shown in
Figure 3, the mole fraction of H2 increases when the temperature increases from 500 ◦C
to 700 ◦C. However, the mole fraction of H2 will be stable at a gasiﬁer temperature above
700 ◦C because the chemical equilibrium is limited at this temperature. Unlike H2, the mole
fraction of CO2 and CH4 decrease with increasing gasiﬁcation temperature. This is because
the Boudouard (Equation (3)), water gas (Equation (4)), and steam methane reforming
(Equation (7)) as the endothermic reaction can shift forward to the product side when the
gasiﬁer is operated at a high temperature. It is noted that the mole of CH4 at 700 ◦C is
equal to zero since CH4 is completely consumed at this temperature. Thus, CO, CO2, and
CH4 can convert to more H2 under a high-temperature operation of a gasiﬁer. From the
simulation result, it is found that the optimal gasiﬁer temperature is 700 ◦C.",0

169,"5.1.2. Effect of S/F Mass Ratio on H2 Production
Figure 4 demonstrates the effect of the S/F mass ratio on the production of H2, CO,
CO2, and CH4 (dry basis). The gasiﬁer is operated at a temperature of 700 ◦C and pressure
of 1 atm, whereas the S/F mass ratio increases from 0 to 10. The simulation results indicate
that the H2 mole fraction increases tremendously with the increasing S/F mass ratio in a
range of 0–2 and reaches a constant value once the S/F mass ratio is above 2. Increasing the
S/F mass ratio means that more steam is fed into the gasiﬁer. This result occurs because
more steam feeding into the gasiﬁer can shift reactions (Equations (4) and (7)) forward. In
the same manner, higher steam in the process can shift the water gas shift reaction, where
CO is converted into H2 and CO2. Therefore, Figure 4 shows the reduction in CO and the
increase in CO2 with an increase in the S/F mass ratio. From the simulation result, it can be
observed that the CH4 mole fraction becomes zero at an S/F mass ratio above 1. This is due to
the fact that CH4 is completely consumed at this ratio. In general, water is typically reactive
at temperatures greater than 800 ◦C and thus, the effect of the S/F mass ratio on hydrogen
production is further investigated at a temperature above 800 ◦C. However, the simulation
results show that the mole fraction of H2 is slightly decreased when the gasifier increases.
This can be confirmed considering that the chemical equilibrium is limited at 700 ◦C.",0

temperature = 950 ◦C.
5.1.3. Effect of CaO/F Mass Ratio on H2 Production
In this section, the inﬂuence of the CaO/F mass ratio varied from 0 to 6 on H2
production is studied, as shown in Figure 5. When the carbonator temperature is at 450 ◦C,
increasing the CaO/F mass ratio from 0 to 2 can strongly enhance the H2 concentration in
the gas product since CO2 is suddenly removed from the syngas. When the CaO/F ratio is
higher than 2, the H2 amount drops slightly and reaches a constant value. This is because a
CaO/F value of more than 2 may be excess from the stoichiometric value. Unlike H2, an
increase in the CaO/F mass ratio causes signiﬁcant decreases in the amount of CO, CO2,
and CH4. This is because CO2 is adsorbed on CaO as an adsorbent. Therefore, the H2
content is higher while the amount of CO2 drops through the carbonation reaction. When
CO2 is removed from the system, the amount of CO and CH4 decrease due to the shifting
of the water gas shift reaction to the product side. Since a CaO/F mass ratio of more than
2 does not affect H2 production, the suitable CaO/F mass ratio is 2.",0

5.1.4. Effect of Carbonator Temperature on H2 Production",0
174,"The impact of the carbonator temperature increasing from 400 ◦C to 800 ◦C on H2
production is also investigated, as illustrated in Figure 6. Because a wide range of carbonator
temperatures is investigated, the presence of two plateaus can be observed. The ﬁrst plateau
can be observed when the carbonator operates at a low temperature (400–650 ◦C). The H2
mole fraction can be improved while CO2 is not present since the carbonator reaction as an
exothermic reaction is favorable to low-temperature operation. Under this low-temperature
range, all of the CO2 can be removed from the syngas and thus, a stable amount of H2 can
be provided. In contrast, the H2 mole fraction will drop and the presence of CO and CO2
can be observed when the carbonator is operated at a high temperature (above 650 ◦C).
Increasing the carbonator temperature can shift the chemical equilibrium backward and
thus, CO2 is desorbed from CaCO3. In addition, the reversed water gas shift reaction can
occur at high carbonator temperatures, which reduces the CO2 and H2 amounts. However,
it can be observed that the amount of H2 is almost constant when the temperature is higher
than 800 ◦C (second plateau). This implies that the chemical equilibrium of reactions is
limited at this temperature.",0

adjusted from 400 ◦C to 1400 ◦C, whereas the CaO/F mass ratio and carbonator temperature
are set as 2 and 600 ◦C, respectively. The simulation result indicates that the regeneration
process begins to desorb CO2 at a temperature of 900–1000 ◦C. This can be observed from
the production of CO2 at this temperature. However, when the temperature is higher than
950 ◦C, the CO2 concentration will be constant. From this study, the optimal regenerator
temperature is 950 ◦C.",0

5.2. Design of Experimental Procedure",0
180,"Since the sensitivity analysis can indicate the trend of results and some operating con-
ditions must be carefully selected, the optimal operating conditions in the gasification and
calcium looping process are determined by using the DOE method. From the results obtained
in Section 5.1, it can be seen that both the gasifier temperature and S/F mass ratio have
significant influences on H2 production. In addition, the proportion of coal in the biomass, or
the coal-to-biomass (C/B) mass ratio, is also an important parameter. Therefore, the selected
parameters in the co-gasification of biomass and coal consist of (A) the gasifier temperature,
(B) the S/F mass ratio, and (C) the C/B mass ratio. In this way, the full factorial design of three
factors with two levels is determined; thus, there are eight numbers in the experiment. The
response results from the 23 factorial experimental design analyses with a single replicate are
shown in Table 4. The ANOVA statistical analysis of the results obtained with a confidence

258,"In this section, the environmental impact in terms of the CO2 equivalent emission and
speciﬁc carbon dioxide emission are investigated. It should be noted that the carbon emis-
sion produced by supplying the necessary heat to the process was not taken into account in
this work. Four cases of the chemical looping process operating at different conditions of
carbonator temperature and CaO/F mass ratio are considered. The environmental impact
assessment is performed to identify the optimal operating conditions that provide the least
amount of CO2 emission. It is noted that all cases are operated at the gasiﬁer temperature
of 700 ◦C, S/F mass ratio of 2, C/B mass ratio of 0.75:0.25, and regenerator temperature of
950 ◦C. Differences in the carbonator temperature and CaO/F mass ratio inﬂuence not only
the CO2 emissions but also H2 production, CO2 capture efﬁciency, and energy efﬁciency.
Table 9 shows the results of the performance analysis and environmental assessment at
different carbonator temperatures and CaO/F mass ratios. The results show that the mass
ﬂow rate of CO2 equivalent emissions from the co-gasiﬁcation of biomass and coal inte-
grated with the calcium looping carbon dioxide capture process is around 1788–1808 kg/h
and that the speciﬁc emission of released CO2 to the atmosphere is 79.77–80.77 g CO2/MJ.
However, it should be noted that this process utilizes a high coal-to-biomass ratio and thus,
the CO2 emission will likely increase compared to conventional biomass-based processes.
Although the chemical looping process is operated at different CaO/F mass ratios and
carbonation temperatures, the mass ﬂow rate of CO2 equivalent emissions and speciﬁc
emission of released CO2 to the atmosphere are not different. From the environmental
point of view, the operation of a chemical looping process at a CaO/F mass ratio of 1 and
carbonation temperature of 450 ◦C is the most suitable in terms of the high amount of
hydrogen and high energy efﬁciency with a low amount of CO2 emission.",0
