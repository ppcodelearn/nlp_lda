need to be addressed for many industrial processes. The most quoted reasons for the deterioration
of dimethyl ether synthesis (DME) concern the sintering and the hydrothermal leaching of copper
particles, their migration to acid sites, the partial formation of copper and zinc hydroxycarbonates,
the formation of carbon deposits, and surface contamination with undesirable compounds present
in syngas. This review summarises recent ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of DME catalyst deactivation and

11,1. Introduction,0
12,"The continuous depletion of conventional energy resources is encouraging the search
for alternative, environmentally friendly fuels. The currently adopted global assumptions in
line with the sustainable development concept dictate the search for zero- or low-emission
energy sources. Among the already proposed clean transportation fuels, dimethyl ether
(DME) is one of the most promising candidates as there are no C–C bonds in the molecular
structure, which leads to signiﬁcantly lower emissions of carbon oxides, particulates, and
other hydrocarbons during combustion in comparison with natural gas. Moreover, its
high cetane number and vapour pressure, like liquid petroleum gas (LPG), allows for
its implementation in already existing solutions for diesel engines and gas turbines. In
industry, it is already used as a propellant, solvent and cooling agent, starting material for
higher oleﬁns and aromatics synthesis, and hydrogen carrier for fuel cells [1].",0
13,"Dimethyl ether may be synthesised from many sources, including natural gas, crude
oil, residual oil, coal, and waste products (glycerol) [1–4]. The sources must be transformed
into synthetic gas and then used directly for DME synthesis. The process of DME formation
proceeds through the catalytic generation of methanol and its further dehydration. The
bifunctional catalyst for the one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) consists of two
mostly physically mixed catalysts: a methanol synthesis part and a solid acid part for
methanol dehydration to DME. The efﬁciency of methanol formation and dehydration
depends on the catalysts’ properties, such as their texture, crystallinity, particle size and
distribution, and strength of acid sites. Apart from small-scale DME synthesis, the industrial
application of one-step DME synthesis is still limited due to the deactivation of the catalyst.
During the process, the deactivation of both the metal part and the acid part may occur.
The most cited reasons for the deterioration of catalytic activity are the deactivation of
the metallic part due to the sintering of copper particles, hydrothermal leaching of copper
particles, migration of copper particles to acid sites, partial oxidation to copper (I) oxide,
partial formation of copper and zinc hydroxycarbonates, formation of carbon deposits on
the catalyst surface, and surface contamination with the undesirable compounds present in",0

such as the pressure, temperature, inlet gas composition, and reactor system. Nevertheless,
the catalysts may be deactivated, and it is crucial to ensure their regeneration.",0
19,"In the literature, insufﬁcient attention has been paid to the issue of the inactivation
and potential regeneration of DME catalysts. Currently, the undertaken research is mainly
focused on the development of new, stable catalysts; however, only a few papers have
addressed the characterisation of the catalyst after the process and attempted regeneration.
In this regard, the aim of this work was to present the current state of knowledge in the
ﬁeld of DME catalyst deactivation, and possibilities for their separation and regeneration.",0
20,2. Methods for DME Synthesis,1
21,Methods of dimethyl ether synthesis involve two main steps:,0
22,"the formation of
methanol (Equation (3)) and its dehydration (Equation (4)) [5]. The occurring chemical
reactions are given below:",0

30,"Consequently, one reaction becomes the driving force for the other to ultimately
obtain dimethyl ether. Depending on the composition and ratio of the inlet gas compo-
nents, the mechanism of DME synthesis differs. To ensure the synergism of reactions
(Equations (2)–(4)), appropriate hybrid catalysts should be used.",0
31,"Catalysts consist of a solid metal and an acid part. The most common metallic part
consists of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 with various additives, which are presented later in this work.
The acidic part is usually γ-Al2O3 [5–9] zeolites [6,8,10–12], aluminium phosphates [13–15]
or amorphous aluminium silicates [16–19]. The metallic part is responsible for methanol
synthesis (Equation (3)) and the water–gas conversion reaction (Equation (2)), and the
acid part is responsible for methanol dehydration (Equation (4)). The higher the acidity
of the catalyst, the faster the conversion rate of methanol to dimethyl ether; however, too
high acidity of the catalyst accelerates the deactivation process and the formation of more
oleﬁns [19]. In general, there are two main methods of DME synthesis, including direct and
indirect routes.",0
32,2.1. Indirect Method of Dimethyl Ether Synthesis,1
33,"At present, dimethyl ether is produced on a large scale by a mixture of synthesis gases
(CO and H2) in a two-step process. The reactions of methanol synthesis and dimethyl ether
synthesis are conducted in two separate reactors. In the ﬁrst stage, methanol is formed from
a synthesis gas mixture with an appropriate volumetric ratio (Equation (5)) over a metal
catalyst—Cu/ZnO/Al2O3. In the second step, the dehydration of methanol over an acid
catalyst (Equation (6)) takes place [20]. The standard pressure and the temperature during
methanol synthesis are in the ranges of 5.0–10.0 MPa and 220 to 280 ◦C, respectively [21].
The scheme of the system for the synthesis of dimethyl ether by the indirect method is
shown in Figure 1. According to Figure 1, methanol is synthesised from the synthesis
gas in one reactor; it is then puriﬁed and synthesised into DME in another reactor. The
reactions take place as shown in the equations below (5). It is preferable to carry out
this process at lower temperatures due to the exothermic reactions taking place and the
resulting by-products, such as ethylene, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and/or coke [9].",1

41,(a) Direct method of dimethyl ether synthesis,0
42,"A single-step method has been proposed as an alternative to the two-step process. The
one-step process combines these two reactions, i.e., methanol synthesis (Equation (5)) and
its dehydration (Equation (6)) to DME, in one reactor with the use of a bifunctional catalyst.
Hybrid catalysts require a combination of metal (responsible for the selective hydrogenation
of carbon monoxide to methanol) and acid sites (to dehydrate methanol and produce DME).
This solution allows for a reduction in the operating costs with higher syngas conversion
and lower steam demand (with a lower H2/CO volume ratio). Additionally, the use of a
single reactor without a puriﬁcation unit and methanol transport allows for a reduction in
the production costs. It also makes the entire process thermodynamically more favourable,
since the conversion from synthesis gas to DME is a highly exothermic process, leading to
an increase in both the carbon monoxide conversion and the DME selectivity [22–24].",0
43,"Despite the many advantages of the one-step DME synthesis process, N. Mota et al. [25]
claimed that the synthesis of dimethyl ether from synthesis gas should not be used for
commercial purposes due to the ongoing site reaction. In this case, two reactions take
place. The ﬁrst one involves the conversion of carbon monoxide with water vapour
(Equation (7)) to carbon monoxide (IV) and hydrogen. The second reaction is the reaction
of carbon monoxide with hydrogen, in which dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide (IV)
are generated (Equation (8)).",0

48,"A better solution is to use a mixture of carbon dioxide with hydrogen instead of
carbon monoxide. Due to thermodynamic considerations, the reaction with CO2 leading
to DME is no longer as advantageous as that for CO, so the yield of DME generation is
ultimately lower. Studies have shown that the low yield of DME synthesis is associated
with a lower equilibrium constant for methanol formation from H2 + CO2 gases and is
equal to K523K = 1.43·10−5 [−] [26]. It is recommended that the hydrogenation of the carbon
dioxide is carried out close to equilibrium conditions. High pressure is also preferred due
to the reduction of the number of moles of H2, and CO2 used in the reaction, and it is",0
49,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
50,4 of 39,0
51,"preferable to operate at a lower temperature than standard at 100–250 ◦C, since a high
temperature promotes endothermic side reactions, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen
conversion. The disadvantage of the process at low temperatures is the necessity to optimise
the operation of the reactors, including the removal of water and the development of more
active catalysts in the carbon monoxide (IV)-proving reaction.
In the DME synthesis
reaction with the participation of CO2, a large amount of water is produced, which is
related to the highly competitive gas–water reverse-conversion reaction, which consumes
CO2 and H2 leading to the lower selectivity of DME. The water generation can also inhibit
the formation of methanol at the hydrogenation sites of the catalysts, since water molecules
tend to be absorbed onto the surface of the catalysts, thereby blocking the active sites.
Moreover, water can damage the structure of acid catalysts [24–26].",0
52,"The scheme of the synthesis of dimethyl ether by the direct method is shown in
Figure 2. The scheme below represents the synthesis of methanol and its dehydration to
DME in a single reactor. The direct synthesis of DME from synthesis gas results from two
main reactions, which are shown below ((9) and (10)). According to the reactions below,
both the methanol synthesis and the carbon monoxide steam conversion reaction take place
in the DME synthesis process. The former plays a key role in the DME synthesis process.
CO2 is a by-product of the reaction, which can be used for methane reformation, in which
the synthesis gas is reformed. The general reaction of the single-step DME synthesis is
strongly exothermic; therefore, the temperature of the process should be properly controlled.
Although the direct synthesis method causes little loss of natural gas, it is one of the most
complicated chemical reactions.",1

57,2.2. Synthesis of Dimethyl Ether from Methane,0
58,"Another method of synthesis is the process of the partial oxidation of methane to
dimethyl ether. It is a direct DME synthesis reaction without the formation of methanol as
an intermediate. This type of process requires a strong oxidant to break the C–H bonds
in methane and oxidise it further to ether. For this purpose, it is possible to use a mixture
of NO and O2; with the use of such a mixture, it is possible to obtain NO + 1/2O2 = NO2
as a result of the reaction. This compound has strong oxidising properties that make it",0
59,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
60,5 of 39,0
61,"possible to obtain DME as the only product during the process. This is also due to its
high selectivity towards ether. It is also necessary to select an appropriate catalyst on the
surface of which the oxidation process takes place. Research is currently underway on the
use of platinum-based catalysts. In the ﬁrst stage, the methane carbocation reacts with
NO3+ on the surface of the catalyst, as a result of which a methanol carbanion is obtained;
additionally, NO is released from the surface of the catalyst. The second stage consists of
the reaction of the formed methanol carbanion and methane carbocation, resulting in the
formation of dimethyl ether, which is released from the catalyst’s surface. In this reaction,
NO2 plays a transport function for oxygen, which itself is not directly involved in the
oxidation process. Currently, the catalyst that performs best in this process is Pt/Y2O3,
which exhibited the greatest activity at 350 ◦C and a pressure of 0.10 MPa. During the tests
carried out under these conditions and the mixture of CH4:NO:O2 inert gas with a ratio
of 20:1:1:78 and the catalyst in the amount of 0.3 g, it was possible to obtain DME in the
amount of 110 µmol/(g·h). The low conversion of methane, at the level of 5%, resulted from
the need to use an excess of it in order to prevent the formation of an explosive atmosphere
in combination with oxygen [27,28] diagram below (Figure 3) shows the likely steps in the
oxidation of methane to DME on the catalyst’s surface.",0

63,3. Structure and Modiﬁcations of DME Catalysts,0
64,"In general, traditional catalysts consist of three parts: the support, the active part,
and the promoter. The vast majority of catalysts used are solid, which do not form a
homogeneous phase with the reactants or the reaction medium. However, in the literature,
there are reports of the use of homogeneous catalysts to obtain dimethyl ether, e.g., the",0
65,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
66,6 of 39,0
67,"use of ionic liquids [29]. Each of the components plays a separate role in achieving the
highest possible activity. The purpose of the support is to increase the surface of the active
phase, and increase the mechanical and thermal strength. The support also contributes to
the enhancement of the stability of the catalyst through the prevention of crystal growth
and the aggregation of crystallites. It should have a high melting point. Moreover, the
important features of the support are the concentration of crystallites. The most-used
materials as catalyst supports include SiO2, α-Al2O3, γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3, MgO, and CaO [30].
The active ingredient directly accelerates the reaction. It is the source of active centres on
which transition complexes are formed. The most popular active phases include metals,
such as copper, platinum, nickel, silver, zinc and nickel oxides, and metal sulphides. The
proper selection of the active phase is crucial in the development of the catalyst. The third
component of the catalyst is a promoter that modiﬁes the catalyst’s properties, such as
its activity, stability, and selectivity. The most-used promoters include magnesium oxide,
zirconium dioxide, and hydrogen chloride. Promoters are added in small amounts, but
they increase the activity and/or selectivity. The promoter may accompany the active
substance or the carrier. Moreover, promoters, such as sodium or potassium, are added
to prevent coke formation through the modiﬁcation of catalyst acidity [31–33]. Due to the
higher selectivity and regeneration, heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, catalysts are
used much more often in practice.",0
68,"A one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether involves bifunctional catalysts. They consist of
a metallic part and an acidic solid part. The metallic part is used to synthesise methanol,
while the acid part is used to form dimethyl ether through methanol dehydration. The
operating temperature of these catalysts ranges from 523 to 673 K, and the operating
pressure is up to 10 MPa [34]. Among the examined metallic phases, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3
(CZA) catalysts are characterised as having the highest activity. Typically, CZA is prepared
by a co-precipitation method, and this is mostly composed of around 50–70% of CuO,
20–50% of ZnO, and 5–20% Al2O3. In Figure 4, the general structure of a bifunctional
catalyst consisting of a metal and an acid part is presented. Metallic copper clusters are
active sites for the conversion of carbon monoxide with hydrogen and for the synthesis
of methanol. The copper surface area inﬂuences the conversion of the synthesis gas to
methanol [35]. Zinc oxide provides enough active sites for gaseous reactants by keeping
active copper in proper dispersion. However, it has been found that excess zinc oxide has a
negative effect on acidity. Moreover, metals, such as aluminium, are also added to increase
the surface area and dispersion of the copper [36,37]. Aluminium and zinc oxides have also
been found to prevent the sintering of the copper particles. Nevertheless, it was observed
that the excess of copper and aluminium oxides increases the activity of the catalyst, as
opposed to zinc oxide, since its excess causes a decrease in the activity of the catalyst [38].
Copper catalysts are mainly prepared using the co-precipitation method [39]. Among
factors that inﬂuence the catalytic activity of copper catalysts are the size of the copper
particles and their dispersion. They depend on the preparation conditions, including the
molar ratio of copper to zinc, calcination temperature, and type of precipitant [38,40–42]. It
has been shown that a lower ratio of copper to zinc has a positive effect on the conversion of
carbon monoxide with water vapour, because it causes the presence of more active sites [43].
To enhance the yields and selectivity of dimethyl ether generation, CZA catalysts have been
the subject of continuous research on their modiﬁcation. The most widely used modiﬁcation
method is the addition of another metal to increase the activity or selectivity and to improve
the dispersion of copper particles. Among the reported additives, magnesium [44,45],
manganese [21,46], zirconium, [33,47,48], chromium [21,46], iron [49], gallium, indium,
lanthanum [50], lithium [51], and titanium [52] oxides or salts may be distinguished.",0

72,"Ren et al. [53] modiﬁed the CZA catalyst with the hydrated salt of zirconium nitrate
(IV) using the co-precipitation method, obtaining the catalyst CuO/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2
(CZZA) with a mass ratio of 4:2:1:0.5. As an acidic part, H-ZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar
ratio of 23:1 was used. The process was carried out in the temperature range of 200–260 ◦C
and under a pressure of 2.76 MPa. Studies have shown that the addition of zirconium
increases the methanol yield and DME generation selectivity. The methanol yield was
12.4% at a temperature of 220 ◦C and under a pressure of 2.76 MPa. The selectivity of DME
synthesis was on the level of 18.3% at a temperature of 240 ◦C under the same pressure.
For comparison, a CZA catalyst with HZSM-5 with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 23:1 was
used. The methanol yield decreased from 12.8% to 10.8% after 100 h of the process. The
characterisation of the catalysts showed that CZZA was less stable during DME synthesis
than during methanol synthesis. It was shown that there was a reduction in the speciﬁc
surface area after the process. In addition, coke was detected on the H-ZSM-5 catalyst,
which caused the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst. Kosova et al. [47] examined the
effect of CZA catalyst modiﬁcation with zirconium and chromium, namely CZA-Zr and
CZA-Cr, respectively. The CO conversion was 60% for the CZA/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, 83% for
the CZA-Cr catalyst, and 68% for the CZA-Zr catalyst. For the above catalysts, the DME
yields were 18%, 15%, and 11%, respectively. The process was carried out at temperatures
of 240 ◦C, 240 ◦C, and 220 ◦C. The pressure was 3 MPa. A tubular reactor was used for
the tests.",0
73,"The efﬁciency of dimethyl ether synthesis strongly depends on the characteristics
of the catalysts. For bifunctional catalysts, different aspects should be considered. A
sufﬁciently high activity during methanol synthesis is inﬂuenced by defects and changes in
the morphology of the copper particles, their dispersion, crystallite size, and interactions
with zinc atoms. The catalytic activity is also directly inﬂuenced by the dispersion of copper,
the reducibility of CuO to metallic copper, the size of the copper grains and their type,
lattice deformation, the crystalline phase of the carrier, and the method of mixing. The
method of its preparation is also a factor inﬂuencing the structure of the catalyst. Among
the most-used commercially used methods, the co-precipitation method is predominant.
However, it is time-consuming as the ageing stage reaches several hours, and the method
also requires the use of large amounts of water in the washing stage. Incorrectly performing",0
74,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
75,8 of 39,0
76,"any step has a negative effect on the catalytic activity of the catalyst. An important element
is the development of effective, fast, and cheap methods of catalyst synthesis [54].",0
77,"The acid part most often consists of Al2O3 [55–57], HPA [38], HZSM-5 [41–44], HY [6],
MCM [53], ion exchange resins [42,58], or H-β [43,59,60]. Acid catalysts contain acid–base
centres, both Brønsted and Lewis, and redox-type (electron-withdrawing and electron-
donating) centres [61]. The total number of acid sites and their strength signiﬁcantly affect
the ﬁnal catalytic activity [32,62]. It has been proven that weak and medium acid sites are
responsible for the dehydration of methanol, while strong acid sites are responsible for
the formation of more oleﬁns. Among the catalysts used for the dehydration of methanol,
γ-Al2O3 is most often used due to its thermal properties, mechanical stability, high surface,
selectivity, and relatively low cost [21,63,64]. The next group of the most-used catalysts
are zeolites. Used for its high selectivity, catalytic activity at low temperatures, and better
stability in the presence of water in comparison with γ-Al2O3, zeolite H-ZSM-5 is one of
the best-examined and most frequently used catalysts in DME synthesis due to its skeleton
topology, hydrothermal stability, and simplicity of physicochemical property modiﬁcation,
such as acidity or texture. The ZSM-5 framework consists of two intersecting channel
systems, with one straight line parallel to (010) and the other sinusoidal running parallel to
the (001) crystal planes. The entrance to the pores is limited by a 10-membered ring with a
diameter of about 55 µm. The most popular methanol conversion products, in addition to
DME, are also oleﬁns, parafﬁns, and aromatics. The channels are wide enough, even for
the diffusion of tetramethylbenzene, and the intersections of the channels are suitable for
cyclisation reactions and intermolecular hydride transfer [65,66].",0
78,"In the case of zeolites, the acidity depends on their structure and the Si/Al molar ratio.
The more commonly used catalyst is H-ZSM-5 due to its more hydrophobic nature than that
of Al2O3. The Al2O3 catalyst loses activity rapidly due to its hydrophilic nature. However,
the use of temperatures above 270 ◦C causes the formation of undesirable by-products—
hydrocarbons. This is due to the high acidity of zeolites. To improve DME’s selectivity and
methanol conversion, the number of acid sites that are responsible for total acidity and its
amount should be reduced [34]. The H-ZSM-5 catalyst is the most-used catalyst for the
dehydration of methanol, because its structure has large amounts of acidic Bronsted sites
and is hydrophobic in nature, which makes it much more resistant to poisoning caused
by the presence of water. The presence of strong acid sites contributes to the formation of
undesirable light hydrocarbons and the deactivation of the catalyst due to the formation of
coke. However, the smaller size of the crystallites of this zeolite and the smaller number of
Bronsted acid centres on its outer surface in relation to alumina determine the activity of
this catalyst. It is important to choose the Si/Al ratio appropriately, as it directly affects the
course of the reaction and ultimately the DME activity and selectivity. It has been found
that the greater the amount of aluminium, the greater the number of acid centres, and,
ultimately, the greater the activity of the catalyst. In a study conducted by J. Abu-Dahrieh
et al. [21], three catalysts for methanol dehydration with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were
tested: NH4-ZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 mass ratios of 23 and 80, H-ZSM-5 catalyst with a
SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 80, and γ-Al2O3. The processes were carried out at two temperatures—
200 and 250 ◦C—under a pressure of 2.0 MPa. As a metallic part, CuO/ZnO/Al2O3
catalysts were used. The processes were performed with the following catalyst ratios:
CZA/HZSM-5 3:1, CZA/NH4-ZSM-5 3:1, and CZA/γ-Al2O3 1:1. The conducted research
has revealed that the most stable catalyst is H-ZSM-5. Additionally, high activity was
obtained with CZA/HZSM-5 catalyst at a relatively low temperature. It was also observed
that the catalyst was slowly deactivated because of the coke formation. In contrast, the
DME yield decreased from 18.5% to 14.1%.",0
79,"Chlorination and ﬂuorination have been proven to be two methods that can effec-
tively control acidity. Chlorinated catalysts show greater activity and selectivity of DME
formation compared with ﬂuorination. On the other hand, performing ﬂuorination and
chlorination simultaneously allows obtaining higher catalytic activity. The conducted
research has also shown that ultrasound also positively inﬂuences the improvement of",0

81,9 of 39,0
82,"activity, which is probably caused by the textural and acid changes that occur during
ultrasound irradiation [67].",0
83,"Similar to the metallic part, the acidic part of the catalyst may be also modiﬁed by
adding metal compounds. The purpose of doping with other elements is the modiﬁcation of
the strength of the acid sites. The methods of reducing the number of strong active centres
include the treatment of zeolites, e.g., ZSM-5, with ammonia or alkylamine, followed by
thermal treatment. It is also recommended to use oxides of sodium, magnesium, lanthanum,
calcium, zircon, aluminium, or zinc by wet impregnation with solutions of these salts, which
increase the selectivity of DME and the stability of the catalyst [21,68–73]. Additionally,
it has been shown that methanol conversion and the improvement of DME selectivity
can be increased by reducing the crystal size of the dehydration catalyst’s part [66]. M. Z.
Pedram et al. [74] modiﬁed the HZSM-5 catalyst with various metals, including 5% of Mg,
Zr, Na, and Al, and 5%, 10%, 20%, 40% and 60 wt.% of Zn. The reaction was carried out at a
temperature of 230 ◦C and 1.9 MPa for 4 h. The process was carried out in a slurry reactor.
The research showed that the best results were obtained for the Zr-modiﬁed H-ZSM-5
catalyst. Zinc contents above 10% reduced methanol conversion. It can be concluded
that, in this range, the zinc oxide crystallised and was not highly dispersed. Zinc oxide
with contents of 5% and 10% were bound to the hydroxyl group and formed Zn (OH)+,
which resulted in an increase in the number of acid sites and a reduction in the number
of Bronsted sites. A catalyst that contains a high ZnO percentage above 10% has lower
numbers of both acid and base sites. H-ZSM-5 also proved to be highly selective for the
dewatering of methanol. The research showed that the catalysts modiﬁed with zirconium
had the highest stability with H-ZSM-5. They achieved 91% of methanol conversion and
91.1% of DME yield. Moreover, it has been proven that the conversion of methanol to DME
is dependent on the degree of acidity, and the selectivity towards DME and the stability
of the catalyst are dependent on the strength of the catalytic sites. In summary, methanol
conversion is lower for the H-ZSM-5 catalyst with the addition of zinc at contents above
10%. The worst results were achieved for ZnO2/H-ZSM-5 with 60 wt% of zinc, resulting in
22% methanol conversion and 22.1% DME yield. They also carried out the process with
Al2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The methanol conversion was 56% and DME yield was 56.1%.",0

85,"The results for different types of catalysts and post-process reactors are presented
below. The focus is mainly on the results obtained that conﬁrm the presence of coke as the
main cause of deactivation.
(a) Thermogravimetric analysis—TGA",0
86,"The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after the process was determined by
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The analysis was carried out with a temperature rise
from 25 to 900 ◦C and a heating rate of 10 ◦C per minute under air ﬂow. At temperatures
below 200 ◦C, mass loss is caused by the thermal desorption of adsorbed water. In addition,
mass loss at temperatures from 200 to 500 ◦C is caused by the removal of amorphous
carbon through the oxidation of CO to CO2, while ﬁbrous and graphitic carbons undergo
gasiﬁcation at higher temperatures [75]. T. K. Obukhova et al. [76] carried out tests in a
tubular-bore reactor (FBR) and in a slurry suspension reactor (SLR) using the Mg/ZSM-
5 catalyst. The TGA tests showed that, at a temperature of about 100 degrees, water
desorption and the degassing of weakly bound hydrocarbon-derived impurities take place
in the pores of the catalyst. At 300 ◦C, mass loss also occurs. This stage is associated with
the removal of the decomposition products of the dispersion medium. These are difﬁcult
to remove from the solid phase of the catalyst after the reaction. In addition, at 500 ◦C,
the oxidation of high-temperature coke sludge occurs, accompanied by the evolution of
gaseous products.
R. Liu et al. [77] conducted a test with an encapsulated CZA catalyst deposited on
a HZSM-5 membrane. They reported that the mass loss in the 50–300 ◦C range was due
to physical resorption on the surface of the encapsulated catalyst and the desorption of",0
87,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0

89,"structural water. The mass loss in the temperature range of 300–600 ◦C can be attributed to
residual model molecules from the capsule catalysts. The mass of these catalysts increases
with increasing temperature, which is attributed to the coke present on the HZSM-5
membrane. Furthermore, a loss of catalyst mass was found in the temperature range of
640–750 ◦C, which was attributed to the combustion of coke during thermogravimetric
analysis. At 800 ◦C, a mass loss of 4.3% was observed, indicating high thermal stability.

a signiﬁcant reduction in acidity for the SO4

reduces the number of strongly acidic sites, thereby weakening the interaction of the carbon
moieties with the catalyst surface. Furthermore, copper’s ability to dissociate H2 and
hydrogenate may prevent coke deposition.",0
92,"It was found that, for the CuO–Al2O3/CuAl2O4 catalyst, the amount of Al2O3 de-
creased by 20.9% and that of CuAl2O4 increased by 79.1%. These changes show that Al2O3
reacts with Cu atoms to form CuAl2O4 during the catalytic reaction. In addition, unbound
CuO particles are dispersed on the surface of fresh CuO–Al2O3, thus providing active sites
for methanol decomposition During the reaction, unbound CuO particles are reduced to
Cu by reacting with H2, which is derived from methanol decomposition. These newly
formed sites are considered active sites for methanol synthesis [79].
(c) XAFS",0
93,"V. Vargheese et al. used a Pt/Y2O3 catalyst and ran the process using methane as
a substrate, bypassing the formation of methanol. The XAFS results showed that there
was a strong interaction between Pt and Y2O3. Pt was shown to be in a partially oxidised
state in Pt/Y2O3 and a partially metallic state in Pt/SiO2. It was conﬁrmed that DME is
only formed in the presence of Pt and NO+O2, but a large part of NO is converted to NO2.
Importantly, the concentrations of NO and NO2 were equal to the initial concentrations,
and no N2 was formed. Thus, it was concluded that NO and NO2 act as oxygen atom
transporters for the partial oxidation of CH4 [28].

94,"The SEM images (see Figure 5) show no apparent change in morphology during the
reactions from 10 to 720 h. The morphology and particle size of the catalyst can cause

a loss of the crystalline phase may indicate the leaching of components of that phase.
Dong-Sheng et al. investigated the structural changes of a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst for
DME synthesis using the XRD method. The study by W. Dong-Sheng et al. showed that

the reaction due to the reduction of the particles to Cu. These particles are reduced to Cu
upon contact with H2, formed from the decomposition of methanol. The formation of H2 is
attributed to the occurrence of methanol decomposition in the CuO active sites, as H2 is
one of the substrates.

In situ methods
The deactivation of catalysts as a result of coking, leaching, sintering or oxidation
has its source in the reaction mechanism. Therefore, it is essential to track the individual
changes taking place on the catalyst’s surface during the catalytic reaction. The study of
changes taking place on the catalyst’s surface is possible with the use of in situ spectroscopic
methods, including XRD and FTIR methods. Kabir et al. [84] investigated the structural
changes in the commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3/MgO catalysts as the metallic part combined
with commercial γ-Al2O3 as the acidic part during DME synthesis using synchrotron
powder diffraction at different temperatures. Up to 250 ◦C, no changes were observed.
Above 250 ◦C, the transition from CuO to Cu was observed. The intensity of the XRD peak
corresponding to the Cu (1 1 1) direction and, therefore, the crystalline size were measured.
It was found that along, with the temperature rise, the crystalline size gradually increased
from 8.5 nm to 15 nm at 250 ◦C and 500 ◦C, respectively. No changes were observed for the
methanol dehydration part, γ-Al2O3, indicating the structural changes in the metallic part
as the main factor of catalyst deactivation. Peaks attributed to graphitic carbon were also
found, indicating the coking of the catalyst’s surface.",0
111,"Miletto et al. [85] investigated the characterisation of a Cu/ZnZr/ferrite catalyst
during the synthesis of DME via the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide using in situ FTIR
analysis. They found that the catalyst underwent the deactivation process due to the loss of
acidic sites. No water or carbon compounds were detected; thus, it was concluded that the
deactivation of the catalysts is associated with the migration of the copper zeolite’s surface
to zeolite internal channels. In situ FTIR analysis was used by Chiang et al. [79]. They
investigated the formation of organic species at the CuO/Al2O3 catalyst surface during
the reaction of methanol dehydration to DME at 150 ◦C, 250 ◦C, and 350 ◦C under 50 bar.
The measurements were performed at selected time intervals during the reaction. They
investigated the formation of DME and formic acid during the reaction. It was found that,
at lower temperatures (150 ◦C), the formation of HCOOH was favoured, while the highest
values of the obtained dimethyl ether were observed at a temperature of 250 ◦C.",0

tech reactors. Among the conventional reactors’ conﬁgurations, ﬁxed bed reactors, slurry

A ﬁxed-bed reactor is most widely used for direct DME synthesis due to its simple

is immobilised in the form of a solid layer on the inner wall of the reactor. Figure 9 shows
an example of a ﬁxed-bed reactor. The disadvantage of using this reactor is the necessity
of the continuous recirculation of the reactants and the associated operating costs. This is
due to the low process efﬁciency of a single run. Another issue that needs to be addressed

gas to DME. M.E.E. Abashar [89] conducted studies in which tests were carried out with
the use of three reactors: a ﬁxed-bed reactor, a ﬂuidised bed reactor, and a slurry reactor.
The resulting CO conversion (Xco), selectivity of DME (XDME), and yield of DME (PDME)
were compared. Those for a slurry reactor were 17%, 70%, and 0.2 g/g/h, respectively;
those for a ﬁxed-bed reactor were 10.7%, 91.9%, and 0.5 g/g/h, respectively; and those for
a ﬂuidised bed reactor were 48.5%, 97%, and 0.45g/g/h, respectively. It was shown that the
highest results were obtained for the ﬂuidised bed reactor (see Figure 10). Moreover, they
possess several advantages: (a) good mixing, which allows isothermal and temperature
control to be achieved; (b) low pressure drop; (c) slight diffusion limitation due to the use
of ﬁne particles; (d) a slight pressure drop; (e) the possibility of using a large amount of
catalyst; and (f) easy circulation of the catalyst to be regenerated [89].",0
121,"The disadvantage of this reactor is the tendency to lose the catalyst due to collision

popular solution, as evidenced by the few literature reports. However, it is an interesting

suspended in inert solvent and comes into contact with the bubbling reactants. This allows
for better control of the temperature distribution and pressure of the reaction, making
it more efﬁcient. The transfer of bulk particles is much slower than that in ﬁxed-bed
reactors. The catalyst in this type of reactor is less prone to deactivation, although losses
may occur during the reaction. However, the disadvantage of this reactor is the need to use
complicated equipment [94,95]. Among the most-used solvents, parafﬁn [19,96–98] white

133,6. Reasons for Catalysts Deactivation—Fixed Bed and Slurry Reactors,0
134,"The issue of the deactivation of the catalyst for DME synthesis, despite many efforts to
modify and improve stability, is still one of the main challenges. Depending on the type
of catalyst, the addition of promoters, such as MgO, ZnO, ZrO2, Ca, Co, Fe, Ca, Ce, and
Ni, and the chosen synthesis route (co-precipitation, physical mixing, sol-gel, adsorption,
ion exchange, and impregnation), the degree of deactivation varies. Moreover, the type
of deactivation also depends on the conﬁguration of the reactor. In the subsections below,
sources and reasons for catalyst deactivation are presented for the two most widely used
reactor systems: ﬁxed-bed and slurry reactors.
(A) Fixed-bed reactors",0
135,"In Table 1, selected catalysts, process parameters of DME synthesis, and reasons
for deactivation are presented. A ﬁxed-bed reactor system is the most often used on a
laboratory scale or in pilot plants due to the low production costs and simplicity [100].
In this type of reactor, the diffusion limitations are eliminated through gas–solid contact.
Moreover, the use of this type of reactor allows the application of an optimal longitudinal
temperature proﬁle from the inlet to the outlet of the reactor. This means that the reaction
rate is high near the inlet, and, by lowering the temperature, high outlet conversion is
achieved. However, the presence of endothermic and exothermic reactions may result in
a drop in efﬁciency and the sintering of the catalyst. The greatest risk is the formation of
so-called hot spots inside the reactor, which cause local overheating and are a direct cause
of catalyst sintering. Studies have shown that the thermal sintering process, in the case of a
copper-based catalyst, is kinetically slow and hardly reversible or completely irreversible;
however, it can be prevented by controlling the process temperature. Consequently, a high",0
136,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
137,17 of 39,0
138,"synthesis gas recycling rate is required to avoid temperature rises, with consequent lower
conversion and ultimately high operating costs [1,100]. An alternative to synthesis gas
comprising H2 and CO is the use of CO2 instead of CO. In this case, an additional reaction
takes place—the water gas shift reaction to hydrogenate CO2. This step is critical to the
process that takes place, as it affects the rate of methanol formation and dehydration, which
is associated with the formation of water [101].",0
139,"Concerning the metallic part of the DME synthesis catalysts, Cu oxidation and ZnO
agglomeration were identiﬁed as the important triggers of deactivation. The structures of
ZnO and Cu should be stabilised to improve the catalyst’s lifetime during hydrogenation to
methanol. The addition of a hydrophobic promoter can stabilise the above compounds and
inhibit the oxidation of metallic copper [80]. It should also be considered that the addition
of a promoter may negatively affect the catalytic activity. Research by H. Bahruji et al.
conﬁrmed that some metal additives block active acid sites. The addition of TiO2 to catalysts
consisting of PdZn and the acid part of H-ZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3 causes a decrease in the
yield due to the blocking of Bronsted acid sites [102].",0
140,"Another factor favouring the deactivation of the catalyst is the formation of carbona-
ceous residues and their deposition on the surface or in the pores of the catalyst, thus
covering the active sites. These residues are widely known as coke, which includes poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A small part of the volatile compounds trapped in the
catalyst pores is considered as the precursor, and not the actual coke. D. Zapater et al. [88]
conducted tests on methanol dehydration to DME using the SAPO-34 catalyst and SAPO-34
combined with bentonite and aluminium with a mass ratio of 50/30/20. It was found
that the SAPO-34 zeolite was rapidly inactivated by the gradual conversion of the active
hydrocarbon’s intermediates into less-active polycyclic aromatics and ultimately into coke.
Moreover, deactivation is caused by the blocking of the pores, making the desorption
process more complex. Low acidity increases the initial concentration of acid sites and
ultimately increases the reaction rate. The results show that, at the beginning of the process,
volatile compounds are formed, the amount of which stabilises with constant concentration.
In the case of sites with high acidity, compounds with higher acidity are initially formed,
which increase the rate of the reaction.",0
141,"Among the factors causing the deactivation of the exchange catalyst is also the inﬂu-
ence of the side reactions of water. The released water promotes the deactivation of the
acid part of the catalyst, thus leading to the formation of carbon deposits. X. Fan et al.
conducted an experiment comparing the effectiveness of CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) and
CuO/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2 (CZZA) at an atomic ratio of 4:2:1:0.5 by the co-precipitation
method. They used CZA and CZZA as the metallic parts and H-ZSM-5 as the acid part
for DME synthesis from CO2 and H2. Although γ-Al2O3 achieves high DME selectivity,
it tends to absorb water, which contributes directly to the deactivation of the catalyst. In
contrast, H-ZSM-5 exhibits higher resistance to adsorption and has strong acid sites (Lewis
and Bronsted), offering high activity in terms of MeOH conversion at a relatively low
reaction temperature (220–260 ◦C) [103].",0
142,"Kim et al. [104] performed the synthesis of dimethyl ether through the dehydration of
methanol over a modiﬁed H-ZSM-5. The H-ZSM-5 catalyst was modiﬁed with a potassium
compound using potassium nitrate at a K/Al ratio of 0.6. The reaction temperature ranged
from 190 to 400 ◦C. The catalytic activity varied linearly with the reaction pressure. As the
ﬂow rate of the feed gas stream increased, the methanol conversion decreased under low
temperatures. Moreover, a decrease in conversion was observed at temperatures below
250 ◦C. Catalyst deactivation is caused by the formation of coke or dealumination, which
causes the gradual disintegration of the crystal structure. The reaction mechanism is mainly
based on the interaction between methanol molecules adsorbed on acid Lewis sites with an
alcoholate anion adsorbed on an adjacent basic site. Generally, the stronger the acid centres,
the more active the catalysts are; however, in the case of Bronsted centres, their strength
and reaction temperature must be controlled to avoid the formation of hydrocarbons. As",0

optimal activity during methanol dehydration.",0
146,"N. Mota et al. [25] discussed Ren et al.’s results about the deactivation of a CZZA/ZSM-
5 catalyst. It has been proven that catalysts can lose their activity due to interactions between
the metal and acid sites, for example, during ion exchange between the hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation catalysts. In addition, a signiﬁcant decrease in the speciﬁc surface area and
an increase in coke amount were observed after 100 h of the process. The presence of zeolite
was found to have an adverse effect on the stability of the catalyst. The results suggest that
zeolite-induced coking may be responsible for the deactivation of the catalyst. Methane
and coke were also formed as by-products during DME dehydration. The formation of
methane is due to the strong binding of methoxylates on acid sites, leading to the formation
of surface structures that lead to decomposition to form CO, H2, and CH4. A regeneration
trial of the Cu-Fe2O4/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in an air atmosphere for 2 h at 600 ◦C was also

272,(B) Slurry phase reactors,0
273,"The second-most-applied reactor for DME synthesis is the slurry reactor. Often,
this type of reactor is used for commercial purposes. The slurry reactor system is often
called a three-phase system, since the gas reactants come into contact with solid particles
suspended in an intermedium. Due to the better heat transfer and lower capital expenditure
in comparison with other solutions, slurry reactors are mostly used on an industrial scale.
Compared with ﬁxed-bed reactors, the temperature control in slurry reactors is much
simpler due to the large heat capacity of the solvent. Nevertheless, the use of this reactor has
some disadvantages, such as the complicated equipment necessary for the proper operation
of the reactor and the loss of catalyst particles during the process [35,94,95,109,110]. The
main advantage of using a slurry reactor includes the even temperature distribution inside
the reactor, which allows for sintering avoidance, and the reduction of energy requirements.",0
274,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
275,20 of 39,0
276,"Moreover, the simple method for the catalyst dosing and separation process additionally
is in favour for this solution. The catalyst particles are introduced by dispersing them in
an inert solvent inside the reactor. However, the lack of wettability of the catalyst due to
the hydrophilic surface and the hydrophobic nature of the organic solvent may lead to the
formation of aggregates and abnormal distributions. The operation life of the DME catalyst
in industrial applications is 4 to 8 years [111,112]. It is limited by catalyst deactivation,
which is caused by poisoning and thermal sintering. According to the research carried out
by Dieterich et al., a decrease in the catalyst activity is observed from 14 to 21% during the
ﬁrst 1000 h of the process. Thereafter, deactivation slows down to about 2% per 1000 h for
3 years. At the end of the catalyst’s life, its activity decreases by 20% [112].",0
277,"Similar to ﬁxed-bed systems, the coking of the catalyst is one of the most prevalent
inactivation factors. In Table 2, selected data on the different types of catalysts and the dif-
ferent conditions of the processes carried out in the slurry reactor with particular emphasis
on the problem of catalyst deactivation in each of the slurry phase processes are presented.
Coke formation is a complex process and arises in many successive stages. Among the
most critical steps are the intermolecular condensation reaction of the reactants and/or
products and the intramolecular condensation (cyclisation) reaction [113]. The most typical
coke hydrocarbons include alkenes, dienes, and polyaromatic compounds. Short-molecule
alkenes and dienes on acid zeolites quickly undergo condensation reactions. This leads to
the formation of polar and heavy products that can be easily trapped on the zeolite’s surface.
Polyaromatic molecules are less reactive compared with alkenes and dienes. However, due
to their higher polarity and volume, these are compounds that are retained more strongly
on acidic zeolites. Their contact time with acid sites is much longer, which forces them to
transform into heavier molecules that no longer desorb from the zeolite.
Coke can be classed as light or heavy. A light coke burns at a temperature of
300–500 ◦C. It consists mainly of volatile and low-condensing aromatic hydrocarbons.
A heavy coke burns at temperatures above 500 ◦C. It consists of much more complex
polyaromatic compounds [6–8]. Coke is formed through a condensation reaction, but also
hydrogen transfer and dehydration. The resulting coke is composed of stable polyaro-
matic compounds. For coke formation on the surface of the catalyst, not only are chemical
reactions required in or inside its pores, but coke retention may also be due to spherical
blockage, strong chemisorption at active sites and its entrapment in pores, low solubility,
and low volatility. These dependencies can occur in combination, as well as independently.
The retention of coke on the catalyst’s surface is usually associated with its low solubility
or volatility. The coke is deposited on both the outer and inner surfaces of the catalyst. In
the case of zeolites, light coke usually deposits in the pores of the zeolite, and heavy coke
mainly deposits on its external surface [112]. Upon the inactivation of H-ZSM-5, the sam-
ples change from white to yellow–brown, suggesting the formation of highly unsaturated
organic substances at around 300 ◦C. However, during methanol conversion at a tempera-
ture of about 450 ◦C, the deactivated catalyst turns black, which proves the formation of
coke. In slurry reactors, the coke is lighter and consists of xylenes and trimethylbenzenes,
in opposition to C4-C6-substituted benzenes. In both slurry reactors and ﬁxed-bed reactors,
the localisation of coke occurs primarily in the microporous channels of the zeolite (>60%).
In the synthesis of dimethyl ether in slurry reactors, the catalyst activity is related to the
blocking of the catalysts’ pores by products originating from the thermal decomposition of
the dispersion medium [76]. An important aspect is the selection of an appropriate catalyst
for the reactions taking place. The following conditions determine the formation of coke:
(a) Reaction characteristics—the type and speed of major and side transformations, the",0
278,"shape and size of reactants and products, and reactor type;",0
279,"(b) Catalyst features—type, number, location, and strength of active sites, and size and",0
280,(c),0
281,"shape of pores and holes;
Process conditions—temperature and pressure [112].
According to [5,25,114], the second of the key factors that lead to catalyst deactivation
is water, which is formed in the methanol dehydration process and becomes trapped",0
282,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0
283,21 of 39,0
284,"in the system due to the resistance created by the slurry. The loss of activity is mainly
caused by the deactivation of the methanol synthesis catalyst. Thus, under the inﬂuence
of water, the morphology of the catalyst changes. Cuo transforms into Cu2(OH)2CO3,
ZnO transforms into Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2, and the synergistic effect between these oxides
is diminished. Studies have shown that use of the γ-Al2O3 catalyst in the synthesis of
dimethyl ether allows achieving high selectivity [25,64,115]. However, the γ-Al2O3 catalyst
is not recommended for this type of process, especially with CO2, because it strongly
absorbs water, leading to the catalyst’s deactivation. According to B. P. Karaman and N.
Oktar [116] the use of this catalyst as a methanol-dehydrating part results in the rapid
deactivation of the catalyst due to strong adsorption on the Lewis acid sites. Lewis acid
sites have also been shown to lead to coke formation during methanol dehydration. Coke
may be deposited on the catalyst’s surface due to the occurrence of the Boudouard or
the methane cracking reactions, as shown in reactions (11) and (12), respectively. More
hydrophobic materials, such as zeolites, e.g., H-ZSM-5 catalysts, are not sensitive to water;
thus, such catalysts are deactivated by covering acid sites or blocking the pores by the
adsorption and deposition of carbon compounds in the channels.",0

288,"The deactivation of the catalyst is inﬂuenced not only by the process parameters,
but also by the method of synthesis and by various types of metal additives. Y. Tan et al.
investigated the effect of manganese on the ﬁnal DME yield. For the tests, they used CZA
and CZAMn catalysts, as well as MnCuZnAl. The catalysts were then physically mixed 2:1
with γ-Al2O3. In the case of the CZAMn catalyst prepared by the co-precipitation method,
it was found that CuO could be easily reduced, and the reduced Cu was well dispersed.
The opposite effect was obtained for the MnCuZnAl catalyst, which was prepared by
impregnation.
It has been found that a higher Al/Zn ratio allows for a higher DME
yield [117]. It has been shown that, during the catalytic process, the crystallite sizes of
copper and zinc oxide signiﬁcantly increase because of copper recrystallisation, despite the
better heat exchange in the slurry reactor. The transformation of Cu2O to CuO leads to a
loss of catalyst activity [118].",0
289,"Moreover, deactivation is also caused by compounds containing sulfur, chlorine, iron,
nickel, arsenic, and carbonyls, which are the cause of the loss of activity. However, sulfur
tolerance is higher compared with that of chloride because it is scavenged by zinc oxide
from the Cu/ZnO catalyst. In addition, the formation of carbonyls and arsenic is favoured
by a high concentration of carbon monoxide, which results from the use of unsuitable steel
grades [119]. It is recommended to use carbonyl traps containing lead oxide due to the
formation of iron and nickel carbonyls that may theoretically form inside pipes, reactors,
and steel gas cylinders in contact with synthesis gas, if their surface is not covered with
aluminium [56,120].",0

methanol, the concentration of which was much higher in the ﬁxed bed compared with

parameters, and change the parameters of the process. It is an interesting alternative for

II. High-Tech Systems
(a) Double-reactor system",0

reactor, the cold stream is preheated by the ﬂowing gases. The water in the ﬁrst reactor
is heated by the heat generated by the exothermic reactions and is then forced into the
second reactor (see Figure 13). This solution allows the production of about 60 tons /day
of DME. This solution allows the reduction of production costs due to the recovery of
heat [1,122,123].",0

ceramic–metal composite, or ceramic [124]. Currently, the most widely used membranes
are amorphous silica, F-4SF, ZSM-5, MOR, SIL, and polymer membranes. However, due to
pore-clogging, and thermal and mechanical instability, there is a need to test more preferred
materials as membranes for this type of reactor. The removal of the in situ water leads to
an improvement in the DME yield and improves the process stability compared with a
conventionally packaged bed. This type of reactor (see Figure 14) consists of two coaxial
tubes: an inner tubular membrane and an outer shell of the reactor in which the catalyst
bed is located. In the case of exothermic reactions, there is a co-current circulation of the
reaction mixture and the coolant to avoid overheating [1,86,125].",0

mass transfer. They are suitable for both exothermic and endothermic reactions. These

ultra-pure DME to be obtained. Reactive distillation (RD) is a process in which reactions
and a product separation process are combined. It is also known as catalytic distillation
(CD) when a solid reactor is used. Studies have shown that the most economically viable
reactions are equilibrium-limited reactions with methanol dehydration. They also allow
for greater process intensiﬁcation and are energy-efﬁcient in terms of cost. A single CD
tower allows for the replacement of the dehydration reactor and distillation column in
conventional DME synthesis processes. The catalytic distillation conditions are mild, as a
temperature range of 40–180 ◦C and pressures of 0.80–1.2 MPa are used. The mechanism of
methanol dehydration itself is very simple. The boiling point of methanol is between the
boiling points of water and DME. The design pressure in the methanol distillation tower is
low due to the large boiling point difference between water and DME. Water and DME can
be drawn from the bottom and top of the CD tower, respectively. DME can also be obtained
by using alternative DME synthesis technology. Among others, simultaneous synthesis

465,"For economic reasons, regeneration and reuse are the most preferred. Catalyst removal
is usually a last resort due to environmental reasons. A typical 500 MW coal-ﬁred power
plant can save between $500,000 and $1,000,000 per year. Research shows that the service
life of the catalyst after its regeneration should be the same as that at the beginning [103].
However, the regeneration of catalysts has rarely been described in the literature.",0
466,"Susceptibility to regeneration is one of the most important properties of catalysts.
Table 3 presents a list of selected catalysts, process parameters, and applied regeneration
methods reported in the literature. In the case of metallic part deactivation mainly due
to copper particles’ sintering, no regeneration treatment may be applied to restore the
appropriate size and level of the Cu particles dispersion. The regeneration of the metallic

469,"dehydration, part-regeneration may be achieved via the removal of deposited coke. As
presented by Cordero-Lanzac T. [40] and others, two steps of catalyst regeneration may
be distinguished. In the ﬁrst step, the catalyst is subjected to annealing at 550 ◦C for 2 h
under nitrogen ﬂow, and in the second step, the coke is combusted in the air ﬂow with a
temperature increase of 5 ◦C/minute from 350 to 550 ◦C. The combustion of coke allows
for the full regeneration of the catalyst. It is very important to age the coke. This is crucial
for industrial-scale regeneration processes [55]. High-temperature annealing under an
inert and/or air atmosphere is the most appropriate for the dehydration part of the DME
catalyst. The residual compounds will be decomposed at temperatures below 400 ◦C. Such
treatment allows recovering up to 90% of the initial activity of the catalyst. T. Cordero-
Lanzac [40] described regeneration using a ﬂow of nitrogen and air. Initially, the catalyst
was regenerated in a nitrogen ﬂow at 350 or 400 ◦C for 10 min and then at 550 ◦C in an air
ﬂow for 5 min. The air regeneration temperature was similar to the calcination temperature
of the catalyst. Although complete coke deposition is observed at 550 ◦C, this does not
mean the complete recovery of catalytic activity. Therefore, two regeneration cycles were
carried out. The ﬁrst regeneration was carried out using nitrogen at 550 degrees for 2 h or
burning coke with a temperature rise from 350 to 550 ◦C. Clear effects of the catalyst acidity
and reaction conditions on the amount and composition of the coke formed were observed.
An increase in the temperature and/or catalyst acidity favours coke deposition, which is
explained by the higher activity of acid sites in secondary reactions. The slight development
of coke structures is explained by its complete combustion during the temperature build-up
from 350 to 550 ◦C. The catalyst completely recovers its activity, which enables its use on
an industrial scale.",0
470,"Y. Luan et al. [131] conducted an experiment using CuOZnOAl2O3/γ-Al2O3-HZSM-5
catalyst in a ﬁxed-bed reactor. This catalyst was then regenerated using three mixtures—
5%O2-He, 5%CO2-He, and 5%N2O-He—for 2 h. The results showed that the best mixture
for catalyst regeneration was 5%O2-He.
In addition, this mixture allowed for the re-
dispersion of the copper particles, which was impossible with the other two mixtures.
Furthermore, the turnover frequency (TOF) value was kept constant at around 4 × 10( −3
s ),
and in the case of N2O and CO2 regeneration, the copper particles were not redispersed,
and the catalytic activity was slightly improved. An increase in TOF indicates that a change
in the nature of the acid sites may occur after regeneration.",0
471,"I. Sierra et al. [55] carried out an experiment with CZA/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in a ﬁxed-
bed reactor with different process parameters. They carried out the process at 250, 275,
325, and 375 ◦C under pressures of 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 MPa at H2/CO molar ratios of 2/1,
3/1, and 4/1. Different molar ratios of water to syngas were used, i.e., 0.08 and 0.2. The
total amounts of coke were 4.1 wt.% and 1.2 wt.%, respectively, due to the amount of water
present in the reaction system. The regeneration was carried out as follows: initially, the
sample was ﬂushed with a helium stream to remove air from the system, and then ﬂushed
with a helium stream at 300 ◦C for 30 min; the next step was to lower the temperature to
150 ◦C and regeneration with a He–O2 mixture of 50% for 30 min. The treatment prior to
burning the coke is of particular importance, as this is intended to age the coke by unifying
its structure. The fraction of coke that requires a higher temperature, between 330 and
380 ◦C, settles on the y-Al2O3 no-bearer and its combustion is not catalysed. It has been
conﬁrmed that the combustion of coke deposited on the metal can start at temperatures
above 150 ◦C. The phenomenon of coke heterogeneity has been observed in acidic catalysts
with a bi-modal pore structure, in which more eluted coke (with a lower H/C ratio) is
generated in the mesopores, and its combustion is slower than that in less-eluted coke,
i.e., more hydrogenated coke generated in the micropores. Temperature-programmed
oxidation (TPO) is an effective tool for determining the morphology of coke, as well as
its location in the catalyst. This heterogeneity of coke combustion is characteristic of the
ageing stage and the use of coke combustion kinetics is of particular importance when
designing industrial-scale regeneration.",0

474,"A. T. Aguayo [132] carried out experiments with two catalysts—CZA/γ-Al2O3 and
CZA/Na-HZSM-5—in a ﬁxed-bed reactor. The regeneration of catalysts was studied using
10 reaction–regeneration cycles. The difﬁculty in the regeneration of catalysts is related to
the acid part. Initially, the catalyst was ﬂushed with helium at 260 ◦C. It was proven that
CuO sintering occurs at 300 ◦C. Coke combustion was carried out in an air–helium mixture,
where the helium content was gradually reduced to avoid the local sintering of the catalyst.
After regeneration, it was found that the CZA/γ-Al2O3 catalyst did not regenerate and,
consequently, the DME selectivity and yield decreased. As the amount of regeneration
increased, the yield reached an equilibrium state, resulting in yield and selectivity that
were half of those of the fresh catalyst. In contrast, the CZA/Na-HZSM-5 catalyst, after
regeneration, regained its catalytic activity after 10 regeneration cycles, resulting in no
contraindications for industrial use.",0
475,"The method of the burning of coke should be carried out with special care due to the
possibility of changes in the metallic part of the DME catalyst [103]. Although coke can be
disposed of by burning at higher temperatures, the decrease in activity is irreversible in the
temperature range from 250 to 350 ◦C due to the thermal sintering of copper leading to the
irreversible loss of active surface. To avoid the sintering of copper articles, multiple cycles
of treatment under oxidation at lower temperatures may be applied. X. Fan [103] presented
two methods of catalyst regeneration with the use of air:
(a) Heating at 250 ◦C for four cycles, with each cycle lasting 10 h;
(b) Rinsing at three different temperatures of 250 ◦C, 300 ◦C, or 350 ◦C for three cycles.
Even though the lowering of the coke removal temperature results in the preservation
of copper dispersion, the heavier compounds, such as oligomers and aromatics, cannot be
removed. They accumulate in the catalyst structure and then agglomerate into larger and heavier
compounds that are increasingly hard to remove at relatively low temperatures [4,103,133].",0

H-ZSM-5 catalyst was used. The experiment was carried out in a tubular reactor, and the

with the use of air for 10 h, with ﬂow of 0.5 l pm, pressure of 0.10 MPa, and temperature
of 570 ◦C. The regeneration carried out in this way allowed the structure of the catalyst to
remain unchanged after six regenerations. Moreover, it allowed the number of aromatics to
be reduced from 56.6% vol. to 30.2 vol.%",0

on the CuO/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction was carried out in a U-type tubular reactor

the formation of by-products, such as CO2, CO, CH4, HCOOH, and many others, which
contribute to the deactivation of the catalyst. Regeneration was carried out in ﬂowing air for
2 h at a temperature of 600 ◦C. The MeOH conversion was 70%, and, after the regeneration
process, was slightly reduced to 66%.",0
478,"X. Fan carried out the experiment of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and dimethyl
ether with a CuO/ZnO/Al2O3/ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalyst. The process was carried out at
240 ◦C and a pressure of 2.8 MPa. The ﬁrst regeneration was carried out at 250 ◦C in air
ﬂow. It was shown to recover most of the initial activity. The second regeneration allowed
recovery of 93%. As the regeneration temperature increased, the percentage recovery
decreased. For a temperature of 300 ◦C, the recovery was 88%, and for a temperature of
350 ◦C, the recovery was 83%. The decrease in activity after successive regeneration cycles
is due to copper sintering under the higher temperature leading to the irreversible loss of
the copper’s active surface. Although the coke can be disposed of by incineration, there is a
partially irreversible loss of activity [103].",0
479,"The main disadvantage of using air for regeneration is the formation and emission of
carbon dioxide. It is particularly uneconomic, because the combustion of coke in the regen-

490,"When regenerating the catalyst, it is recommended to additionally use an increased
pressure of 0.10 to 1.0 MPa. The location and nature of the coke also have a strong inﬂuence
on the hydrogenation of coke. In most cases, the coke is only partially removed; as the
H/C ratio is increased, the coke is partially reacted to form lighter compounds. Studies
have shown that coke is removed from the Brønsted acid sites on the inner surface of the
catalyst, while the outer surface remains intact. Thus, the complete removal of the coke
by hydrogenation is impossible, and the elevated operating conditions may degrade the
catalyst [135].",0
491,"Among the strategies to prolong catalysts’ service time, deposit prevention has also
been reported in the literature. This is most often achieved by manipulating the struc-
ture and composition of the catalysts. Dealumination is one of the methods of zeolite
modiﬁcation, but also one of the causes of catalyst deactivation. It involves the partial
removal of aluminium from the tetrahedral skeletal sites and them taking up an extra
molar position. For this purpose, the zeolite is most often treated with steam, acids (organic
and inorganic), chelating agents, such as H4EDTA, salts, or inorganic ligands, such as F-.
Aluminium removal is also possible by using an additional silicon source, e.g., SiCl4 or
(NH4)2SiF6 [111]. This causes some micropores to be partially converted into mesopores.
Although the microporous structure favours the formation of small molecules, such as
oleﬁns, during methanol conversion, it does increase the formation of carbon deposits [136].
R. Liu et al. [77] used CZA nanoparticles with HZSM-5 membrane. HZSM-5 was
synthesised by tetrapropyloammonium hydroxide as a templating agent. In this catalyst,
CZA is used as the core and HZSM-5 as the shell. They carried out an experiment of
DME synthesis from H2–CO2 mixtures in a ﬁxed-bed reactor under 3.0 MPa pressure and
a temperature of 270 ◦C. They used a volume ratio of substrates CO2/H2 of 1/3. They
observed coke formation on the surface of the acid part, which was a reason for the catalyst’s
deactivation. The methanol formed in the core can then pass through the zeolite shell to
achieve sufﬁcient contact with the active sites of the H-ZSM-5 shell to ultimately transform
them into end-products. These factors make it possible to achieve higher availability of
reagents to the active sites. The inner part of the core-shell structures is most likely free
from thermal agglomeration, as it is insulated from other outer surfaces. Additionally, the
H-ZSM-5 catalyst can be dispersed in voids and pores to prevent active site aggregation
during catalyst calcination.",0
492,"For the industrial conversion of methanol to DME, γ-Al2O3 catalysts have the highest
efﬁciency. The modiﬁcation of γ-Al2O3 by ZSM-5 may result in improved reactivity,
resistance to deactivation, and hydrothermal stability. They also prepared ZSM-5/γ-
Al2O3/LC formed by liquid-phase coating. The conversion of methanol was 91.9% and
selectivity of DME was 100%. During the preparation of the liquid ZSM-5, the main problem
was the desiliconisation and dealumination of part of the skeleton in ZSM-5 due to the",0
493,"Energies 2022, 15, 5420",0

495,"change in the pH of the raw material. Moreover, the low charge density of ZSM-5 modiﬁed
the surface charge properties of γ-Al2O3 and improved the hydrothermal properties of the
composite catalyst [137].",0
496,"To avoid deactivation by water, this catalyst should be appropriately modiﬁed, and its
strongly hydrophilic properties should be inﬂuenced. Studies have shown that modifying
this catalyst with metals, such as silver and copper, which act as electron acceptors, increases
its activity and selectivity. The enhancement of the improvement in catalyst activity is
associated with the improvement in Lewis acidity and improved surface properties by
reducing hydrophilicity [58]. γ-Al2O3 and η-Al2O3 catalysts both have Lewis acid–base
sites, mainly with weak and moderately strong acid centres, and Bronsted acid centres.
Interest in them is still high due to their low price, high mechanical strength, large surface
area, and excellent thermal stability [138]. In the case of a variety, η-Al2O3, research by
A. I. Osman et al. showed that the addition of 10% Ag in the form of AgNO3 to the
synthesis caused an increase in catalytic activity in the temperature range from 180 to
300 ◦C under atmospheric pressure. The same catalyst was also presented, but with
different silver contents, namely 1% and 15%. The tests were performed in a ﬁxed-bed
reactor at WHSV = 48.4 h−1. Moreover, a higher degree of stability under steady-state
conditions was found due to an increase in Lewis surface acidity and hydrophobicity. In
conclusion, a balance between acidity and hydrophobicity is needed to achieve optimal
activity during methanol dehydration. H. Jiang et al. [139] carried out the synthesis of
γ-Al2O3 with the addition of copper at contents of 2%, 5%, 8%, and 15%. It was shown that
the most optimal copper content in this catalyst was 5%. As a result of the research, the
CO conversion was 72% and the DME selectivity was 69%. The experiment was carried
out in a tubular reactor, where the catalyst content was 1 g, at a temperature of 310 ◦C
and 5.0 MPa. The authors also suggested the use of the above catalyst with copper as a
bifunctional catalyst for the synthesis of dimethyl ether.",0

653,"Summarising the table above, air or helium/air mixture is most often used for catalyst
regeneration. The regeneration carried out with air or helium/air mixture allows the
catalytic activity to be recovered. Furthermore, it has been conﬁrmed that the use of a 5%
O2/He mixture allows the re-dispersion of the copper particles, which is impossible with
N2O or CO2 mixtures. Process temperatures higher than 300 ◦C are not recommended, as
they result in the sintering of the copper particles, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.
The deactivation process is also affected by the presence of water. As shown in [55], the
more water there is, the more coke there is in the sample. Additionally, the temperature
of coke sparging should be chosen appropriately, because temperatures between 330 and
380 ◦C cause the combustion of larger coke fractions, but, at the same time, cause coke
deposition on the γ-Al2O3 support and faster deactivation of the catalyst.",0

655,"Dimethyl ether (DME) is an alternative fuel. The high interest is due to its properties
and high potential as a new-generation fuel. DME is an alternative to diesel, as an additive
to LPG, or as an alternative to methane in gas turbines. However, the use of dimethyl ether
and the complete replacement of another fuel with it is a very long process. It requires
the construction of appropriate infrastructure, which is necessary for the supply of raw
materials, and appropriate apparatus, and the development of the machine industry. The
DME synthesis process requires the use of CO or CO2, greenhouse gases largely generated
during the production of fossil fuels. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the formation of
these gases; therefore a technology to limit their production should be developed.",0
656,"The major problems that effectively hinder the effective preparation of dimethyl ether
include the deactivation of the catalyst, the water produced, and the deposition of coke
on the catalyst’s surface. The synthesis of DME from CO2 and H2 causes the formation of
more water compared with the synthesis gas, which directly affects the faster deactivation
of the catalyst and the results. This is due to the hydrophilicity of most catalysts. The
ﬁnal process efﬁciency is also inﬂuenced by the catalyst preparation method, its type, the
process parameters, the type of reactor, and the gas ratios used during the process. In this
case, further research is necessary, which will clearly indicate the appropriate parameters of
DME synthesis. These should include high-performance catalytic systems, and the catalysts
should be reusable, cost-effective, and highly water-resistant. Proper puriﬁcation of the
synthesis gas is also essential to prevent the poisoning of the catalyst during the synthesis
of methanol. An important element that is often overlooked in the available literature is the
problem related to the regeneration of catalysts. There is also a noticeable difference in the
availability of literature on the reactors used. The most popular of these is the ﬁxed-bed
reactor. The second-most-used reactor is the slurry reactor. However, there is little actual
literature describing both the slurry reactors and the deactivation and regeneration of
the catalysts. There are still too few studies that have conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the
proposed solutions. Despite the attractiveness of dimethyl ether, it is necessary to intensify
research and expand knowledge on the above-mentioned problems to ﬁnally obtain an
economically attractive process that will allow reducing the use of fossil fuels and striving
for an increasing number of green fuels.",0
