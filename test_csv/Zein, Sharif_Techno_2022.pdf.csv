4,"Abstract: This paper examines a novel approach to activated carbon (AC) production that uses pea
waste (PW) and to what extent it is economically competitive with current production methods.
Additionally, the outcome is to provide a detailed economic analysis to understand whether this
process is viable. The focus of this production route and the economic analysis will be on a United
Kingdom (UK) basis. The plant will be located within the north UK to minimise storage and
transportation costs. It also has extensive links to other clusters of nearby industries that would
produce from this process in air pollution control or wastewater treatments. The overall production
process is detailed, and detailed equipment speciﬁcations, including the sizing of equipment and
utility requirements, were also given. Material balance calculations are carried out to assess the
performance and improve process design. An economic analysis is performed to study the potential
of biomass-to-AC conversion costs and commercialisation viability. The project’s investment is about
£100 million. The cost of the plant can be recovered from year 3 (mid) for the 20-year life of the
plant. The Net Present Value (NPV) is based on cumulative cash ﬂow. The NPV is calculated as GBP
4,476,137,297.79 for 2020, and the associated internal rate of return (IRR) and the return on investment
(ROI) for the project are 55% and 52%, respectively.",0

7,"Converting waste into value-added compounds such as activated carbon (AC) is
stemmed from the growing negative environmental impact and increasing limitations of
fossil fuel resources. Research in this field has accelerated as energy consumption increases
over time [1]. Utilising biomass provides a path to combat or mitigate the increasing
worldwide demands for energy [2]. This international effort intends to utilise new and
alternative technologies, which would lower the changes associated with environmental
pollution and, in turn, global climate change through the development of industrial and
agricultural technologies from renewable means such as biomass waste. The transition to
cleaner energy or materials from renewable resources can be enhanced, allowing nations to
have energy security and achieve sustainable development [3]. The significant challenges
include integrating with the petrochemical industry, utilising robust technologies, and
providing a surplus amount of biomass feedstock for valorisation. Determining a viable and
sustainable process route can help increase stakeholder cooperation across value chains.",0

energy’ and lessening the hold on limited fossil fuel supplies. The global energy production",0

18,"from biomass has expanded progressively, accounting for 70% of the total renewable
supply in 2017, with a technical potential estimated to be as high as 1500 EJ/year by
2050 [4]. Tripathi et al. [5] reported increasing interest and development to utilise biomass
residues, explicitly concentrating on the bioenergy sector. This would require signiﬁcant
research and development investments in specialist product development for alternative
fuels and biochar production. The global annual generation of biomass waste is estimated
to be 140 Gt [5]. These can be feedstocks for various products ranging from the production
of fuel, polymers, and wastewater treatment materials. The selection of using biomass
from agricultural waste is an interesting route. There is a keen interest in using biomass to
produce AC. It provides a two-fold solution for tackling the growing pollution strategy,
considering global food waste statistics are estimated to be 1.3 billion tons annually [6]. The
carbon derived from biomass prevents the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane
(CH4). Furthermore, it can produce industrially more useful AC and enter the natural
carbon cycle process [7]. This development of utilising harvest waste will also implement
a circular economy by utilising wastes as resources, which current policies have adapted
in Europe [8]. Reducing waste levels and ﬁnding the most sustainable solution with an
efﬁcient valorisation route to manage the remaining harvest waste will close the loop. [9].
We recently demonstrated pea waste as a new and promising treatment for wastewater. A
cost-effective alternative to AC is widely available. This will be particularly useful in newly
industrialised countries facing high water pollution and needing a rapid, inexpensive, and
efﬁcient solution [10].",0
19,"In 2017, 40,000 hectares of peas were grown in the UK, and more than 30% (w/w) of
waste is produced during pea harvesting [11]. The remaining unavoidable waste from
harvesting leaves behind other parts of the plant: pods, stalks, vines, and leaves [12].
Danish and Ahmad [7] studied the potential applications of biomass waste from harvest
as a viable alternative to the expensive production process of AC from coal. In India, pea
peel waste was used to produce cellulose as it was cheap and readily available. It was a
valuable and unused form of energy to produce cellulase [13].",0
20,"The potential of utilising agricultural waste to produce carbonaceous materials such
as AC (derived from biochar) can be an efﬁcient process. There are different routes to
produce biochar, including fast pyrolysis, slow pyrolysis, ﬂash pyrolysis, torrefaction and
hydrothermal carbonization, and microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) [14–18]. MAP uses
microwave irradiation for pyrolysing biomass to produce bio-oil and biochar products.
Ge et al. [19] reviewed the feasibility of using MAP on agricultural waste. Besides, MAP
offers fast heating of the extraction mixture via microwave irradiation [20]. Touhami
et al. [21] used rice husk as a heterogeneous acid catalyst and established 30 min for
the optimal carbonisation duration of the MAP. Currently, using MAP large scale has
not been understood for continuous production in terms of product yield and reactor
design. Fodah et al. [18] compared the literature values of corn stover biomass (similar
proximate analysis of PW) products yielded from a catalytic and non-catalytic MAP. It
was found that the yield of biochar decreased when the MAP was increased from 500 W
to 900 W. The bio-oil yield increased from 500 W to 700 W and decreased to 900 W. The
relation between the lignocellulosic content of varying agricultural waste is important
for MAP’s biochar and bio-oil product yield. Similar lignocellulosic content to PW was
compared with that undergoing a valorisation process. Results indicate a 20–40% yield
of biochar and bio-oil each. Xia et al. [12] utilised MAP on pea vine to produce bio-oil
and biochar. The optimal production conditions were 300 ◦C, 250 psi, and 300 W for
15 min. It was found that the bio-oil had a high content of phenolic compounds, and
the biochar had a gross caloriﬁc value of 26.6 MJ kg−1. The caloriﬁc value indicates a
viable and efﬁcient method of utilising PW to produce AC and bio-oil in conjunction (due
to its phenolic content). Currently, biochar’s main uses include applying biochar to the
soil to improve soil fertility [22] and ‘energy production, livestock production, carbon
sequestration, wastewater treatment, toxins remediation’ [23]. However, AC is the main
desired product for this plant. It has scope for many adsorptions and catalysis applications",0
21,"Processes 2022, 10, 1702",0
22,3 of 22,0
23,"due to its high surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution [24]. Biochar can
also be used as a precursor of value-added AC. There are various methods of activation
processes of biochar, including mechanical, physical, and chemical activation, which leads
to different properties of AC. Chemical activation involves treating with acids, bases, and
oxidisers, and thermal activation involves re-pyrolysing at a greater temperature than the
initial production temperature of pyrolysis [25]. Chemical activation has gained increased
attention. It has one-step and two-step methods, and the latter has an increased purity of
99.9% in terms of porosity and yield (higher surface area and pore volume) [26].",0
24,"Currently, there is no solid work or investments to utilise harvest waste biomass
application of chars. The economic analysis will be novel as Kaczor et al. [9] reported
that a comprehensive route has not been determined on an industrial scale, as the known
production of biomass supply within the UK is unclear. One reason could be that there
is a lack of industrial-scale plants [23] for this intended use. There is an absence of a
comprehensive cost analysis for the whole biomass supply chain derived from harvest. The
economic analysis identiﬁes favourable scenarios in the valorisation process [27,28].",0
25,"Detailed economic analysis of the production plant from PW must consider the py-
rolyser’s purchased and operating cost, feedstock’s price, and energy requirements. The
capital costs will be similar for all biomasses [22]. Optimum operation performance will be
the lowest possible temperature and the fastest time. Stella Mary [29] reported the opti-
mum temperature for char yield was 300 ◦C, where maximum values in the pea pod were
21.14 %, and the ﬁxed carbon content pod were lower when compared to peel and vine. It
is also very important to consider the yield of biochar production. These parameters can
be estimated based on TGA analysis [30]. The feedstock price will be the most signiﬁcant
difference and impact the costs of biochar production. The biochar produced through the
pyrolysis process in bioreﬁneries will be combusted to meet energy needs, and any excess
energy can be sold to the electricity grid. The economic value of biochar can be improved
by upgrading it to activated carbon.",0
26,"Tadda et al. [31] reported that in 2014, there were about 1.1 million metric tons of AC
from AC industries, with a 10% increase in the projected demand. In the USA, there is
an expected increase in demand for AC due to new federal laws requiring the removal
of heavy metals from efﬂuent streams. The world demand shows that the Global AC
Market is forecasted to be worth USD 14.07 Billion by 2027, as reported by Emergen
Research. The main applications are water treatment and air puriﬁcation. This increase
in demand can introduce and enforce standards and legislation of various countries in
the global effort to combat air and water pollution caused by fast industrialisation [32].
The increasing manufacturing activity in developing countries will also be a factor in the
increased demand for AC. The commercial application of AC is one of the most widely used
industrial adsorbents for separation, puriﬁcation, and recovery processes [33]. The main
route of producing AC from wood, petroleum coke, carbon black, coal, and lignite has high
production costs. Hence, this generated the interest in utilising the low-cost agricultural
wastes with relatively high carbon as the raw materials substitute for AC. The requirement
for sewage and wastewater treatment is generating demand for AC. This can be due to
the rising global pollution levels due to the growing population and requiring puriﬁcation.
Despite the growing demand, the high price of raw materials impedes the market growth.
This paper intends to determine an applicable route to produce AC from agricul-
tural pea waste (PW) in the UK due to its multipurpose in industry processes (adsorption,
wastewater treatments, and soil fertilisation) and to what extent it is economically com-
petitive. This differs from the conventional route of slow pyrolysis to produce biochar, a
precursor of AC. This route utilises microwave power for better heat transfer as well as
uniformity. An extra activation unit will produce AC with a higher surface area. In addition,
a bio-oil produced from the process can still be used as a valuable commodity to be sold.
The process can provide economic, social, and environmental beneﬁts [34]. It will raise the
issues of suitable infrastructure and require more integration within the food supply chain
rather than working independently to allow for efﬁcient food waste management and a",0

29,"more sustainable solution. The plant’s location will be based in the UK, near the availability
of peas [35]. Minimising transport costs will allow for sustainable infrastructure for future
operations to decrease the biochar technology’s carbon footprint, enabling it to meet Net
Zero standards. In addition, a process model to produce AC from agricultural PW will
be delivered and, in turn, quantify, as far as possible, the potential effect of the selected
through the costs and advantages of AC from agricultural PW within the UK. The economic
analysis will be more conducive to determining whether using PW from the industry with
the newly designed infrastructure can better manage the waste supply chain. Moreover, it
will also indicate whether it can compete with the already current production method of
AC from agricultural waste.",0
30,2. Overall Process,0
31,"The overall process will be discussed, including pre-treatment, pyrolysis, separation,
and activation. Considerations into heat and mass transfer will be explained for the main
unit operations (this will be shown on the process ﬂow diagram). Mass balance is provided
as it is essential to control processing in terms of the yields of the products.",0
32,2.1. Process Route,0
33,"MAP involves storing feedstock, drying, pre-treatment, separation of biochar, bio-oil,
and gas; the chemical activation of biochar, reﬁning the oil, and storing and transporting
the products sold. The PW is initially dried and then shredded or milled through multiple
grinders. It is dried typically using a rotary dryer with a moisture content of 5% [14]. Then
the dry biomass goes through a MAP reactor such as a ﬂuidised bed or ﬁxed bed reactor.
The reacted products then go through the cyclone, separating the products into gases. The
liquid (bio-oil) is collected and condensed in a condenser to produce bio-oil [36]. The
non-condensable gases (NCG) may be used for heating purposes or sold off. The biochar
collected undergoes chemical activation and subsequent washing, drying, and storing of
the ﬁnal carbonaceous product. The porosity of biochar produced from MAP is higher
than that produced from conventional pyrolysis. Furthermore, the following assumptions
were made due to the challenges of measuring a transient temperature within the heated
feedstock.

35,2.2. Pre-Treatment Process,0
36,"Pre-treatment methods are important for biomass as they make it more compatible
with the speciﬁc energy conversion of pyrolysis and enhance its properties. The overall
cost of the production process can be reduced by increasing the pre-treatment efﬁciency.
Size reduction and pre-treatment process are signiﬁcant for thermochemical conversion.",0
37,"Drying is the primary step as the quality of biochar or biofuel can be affected by the
moisture content [12]. Reducing the water content to a level low enough can also prevent
the growth of microorganisms, reduce enzymatic reactions, and improve the combustion
performance [37,38]. The PW chosen for the study is assumed to have a moisture content of
12.7% on dry basis from farmland drying, which needs to be dried further to 6–8% as this
was ideal for optimum biochar characteristics [30] for pyrolysis. The dryer type selection is
based on the bed height and airﬂow velocity at the speciﬁed temperature. This determines
the energy requirement. Fluidised bed drying is most common as this can be batch or in",0

50,"After drying, milling is an important step despite the high energy requirements [40–42].
The PW is shredded, ground, and sieved to 0–200 mesh (0–0.090 mm). After the necessary
physical pre-treatment method steps, chemical pre-treatment is often used to prepare the
biomass using an alkali, such as NaOH, and acids, such as H2SO4. These were found to be
the most effective [41].",0
51,2.3. MAP Pyrolysis for PW,0
52,"Microwave heating is used for pyrolysis at medium speed with an effective heat
transfer proﬁle. The appeal is the increased process yield, environmental ease, and lower
space and capital equipment [43–45]. Ethaib et al. [46] summarised the pyrolysis reaction
of biomass. However, there are currently no reports on the economic viability/feasibility
of MAP reactors for large-scale applications of biomass pyrolysis for bio-oil and biochar
production. Furthermore, the main operation mode of MAP was found to be a batch
reaction on an experimental scale. The aim is to transfer this to a continuous mode carried
out MAP of biomass in continuous mode with a higher rate of biomass recycling.",0
53,2.3.1. Microwave Absorbers,0
54,"MAP of biomass not only needs catalysts, but it also requires microwave absorbers as",0
55,"biomass is generally not a good absorber of microwave [14,26,47].",0
56,2.3.2. Catalyst Selection,0
57,"The proposed plant is designed and modelled using the proximate, elemental analysis,
and caloriﬁc value assumptions. The feedstock is entered at 1443 kg/hr, and the biochar
produced is assumed to be at 35% of the initial feedstock at 498 kg/hr. The selection of
catalysts is critical [48,49].",0
58,2.3.3. Separation,0
59,"The next step after the MAP reaction is separating the three main products. Separating
the char is essential as it can act as a vapour cracking catalyst at lower temperatures.
Moreover, it can form polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in pyrolysis processes.
Multiple cyclones can separate the sold product (char) and condensed to separate the
non-condensable gases and the bio-liquid. The initial separation can be operated similar to
a ﬂash drum at a temperature of 100 ◦C and pressure of 1.01325 bars [50]",0
60,2.3.4. Activation,0
61,"The operating conditions of physical activation that affect the quality and yield of the
AC produced are the activation time, the activation temperature and the vapour mass ratio of
the char. Table 1 gives chemical activation process parameters for MAP. The activating agents
affect activated biochar’s porosity (e.g., microporous, mesoporous). The main activating agents
used are H3PO4, ZnCl2, NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, and K2CO3. The main advantages of H3PO4
are maximizing yield and surface area while minimizing activating agents and microwave
energy [24]. The biochar is treated with H3PO4, heated between 300 ◦C and 600 ◦C, and then
washed with acid or base to remove the activating agent [51]. The intensive washing required
after activating can generate a significant amount of wastewater. Studies by Azargohar and
Dalai [52] tested activation times between 0.9 h and 4 h, activation temperatures ranging from
600 ◦C to 900 ◦C, and mass ratios of steam to char between 0.4 and 2.",0

77,"The main unit operations of this process will be outlined, and a detailed description
of the overall production process, with relevant design speciﬁcations of equipment that
include the sizing of equipment and utility requirements, were also given. Table 2 provides
equipment operating conditions. The process ﬂow diagram and material balance are given
in Figure 1 and Table 3, respectively.",1
78,"Dryer (V-101) is the first operation after PW transport and storage. Biomass was
assumed to have a 12.7% moisture content after naturally drying. Then, 183.26 kg/h
of moisture content is removed from the feedstock. Hence, the initial amount of PW is
1260 kg/h. The dryer uses air-drying to reduce the moisture content to 1% (ideal for MAP).
The required air for the drying was calculated at 5129.66 kg/hr. The air was heated with low-
pressure steam at 210 ◦C calculated using Tube-Shell Heat Exchanger Design Calculation
Software. It was modelled as a shell and tube heat exchanger (E-101) and can be calculated
using air temperature, moisture content, and humidity ratio [54]. A rotary dryer would
then be required to remove the water before entering the miller unit operation (V-102).
The dryer operates at 200 ◦C at close to atmospheric pressure. It operates by utilising the
gravitational forces to rotate the machinery. Rotary driers have high thermal efficiency. They
also have relatively low capital and labour costs [55]. The remaining water is collected and
utilised to optimise the plant operation. The calculation of air gas flow rate is provided
in Appendix A. This is crucial because the higher moisture content in the feed consumes
process heat downstream and contributes to lower process yields. A rotary dryer was
selected as it is the most common for commercial processes. It also is beneficial as it is less
sensitive to particle size. The final dried product has a composition of 12 kg/hr of water.",1
79,"Miller unit operation (V-102) is intended for size reduction. It is an expensive and
energy-intensive process. The intention is to reduce the dried PW of average 8 mm to
3 mm. Without this unit operation, the feedstock would not be suitable for thermochemical
conversion. The selection of the grinder is important for reducing energy. For example,
if the grinding device is a knife, the geometry and direction of the cut affect the resulting
feedstock’s conﬁguration. This will reduce power requirements and the quality of the
surface of the feedstock. The grinding type affects the reaction’s efﬁciency as the raw
biomass harvested from ﬁelds undergoes a coarse grinding process [56]. Newbolt [57]
reported that the hammer mill is the most preferred for biomass size reduction. The tested
variables were screen size, angular velocity, time, feed rate, type, feed size, load, moisture
content, and process. The main measured factors for grinding are particle size distribution,
speciﬁc grinding energy, geometric mean particle size, moisture content, bulk density, and
absolute density [56].",1

and water with the dried PW. The extractor operates at 121 ◦C and 2 bara. Chemical pre-
treatment is a useful process after a mechanical operation. It is generally done to eliminate
ash and hemicellulose [58]. The liquid to solid ratio is 1 to 10 with 20 wt% as H2SO4 and
80 wt% water (dilute acidic system). Since acid can cause corrosion to the equipment,
corrosion-resistant construction material is required, such as stainless steel 304 [55], which
is generally expensive. A centrifuge system is typically used for a solid-liquid system. The
extraction unit is assumed to have 98% efﬁciency but can reach 99%. This stream is now
entering the reactor.",1
150,"The most common reactor for MAP is the fixed bed and fluidised bed (R-101). Ge et al. [19]
reported that biomass waste with a smaller particle size has a higher pyrolysis rate, achieving
higher temperature with lesser heat loss. In that context, the fluidised bed reactor is more
economical than a fixed bed reactor as large particles promote volumetric heating. However,
there is a concern if rapid gas sparging in a fluidised bed reactor leads to significant heat loss,
meaning the reactor requires a higher energy input (3.5–4.2 kJ/g) than the fixed bed reactor
(2.2–2.5 kJ/g) for MAP. These reactors are proposed in terms of batch processing. The reactor
configuration for continuous mode would be a rotary kiln, conveyor belt, or auger screw
conveyor. The operating conditions of the reactor are at 300 ◦C, 500 W, and 1.5 bar, this reaction
assumes something like batch operation, and in literature, it was reported that continuous
mode has not been robust. The product conversion is assumed to be 35% for oil and char and
30% for gas [14–17]. Due to higher pressure, nitrogen is mixed with 20% of the feed as inert to
minimise explosions. Further, the graphite catalyst is going at a bed volume factor of 0.2, and a
calcium oxide microwave absorber is placed in the reactor as 10% of the feed.
The solid separator is designed as a cyclone (V-104) operating at 350 ◦C. The particle
size of char is important as it affects the design and performance of cyclones and filters.
More than one solid separator can be used. Cyclone is the most appropriate equipment to
separate solid from gas streams for particulates with diameters greater than 0.01 mm. A
mesh pad is used to separate liquids from gases. Ideally, it should be designed as a vertical
drum with sieve plates to collect the oil. It was found that char can be collected more as the
cylinder height is increased with a high flow rate. The safety issues are associated with the
vertical orientation; therefore, wall thickness is important. The cyclone can be made from
low alloy steel as the gas contains hydrogen, and the sieve plates are made out of stainless
steel as the gas is corrosive [59]. The operation efficiency of the separator is assumed at 98%.",1

336,"A quenching tower is used (V-105) to allow for a rapid condensing of the oil stream
operating at 50 ◦C, allowing the volatile vapours to quench and avoid secondary reactions
that convert condensable vapours to non-condensable gases [60]. The gas products go
into the compressor (C-101) to maintain pressure. A centrifugal compressor is assumed
to have an efﬁciency of 75% and can also be cooled to 43 ◦C. Condensers (CO-101) in
this process are assumed to be only one; however, for greater efﬁciency, there should be
three condensers and varying temperatures of 80, 50, and 30 ◦C in which the oil would be
collected. Direct contact condensers are used for this process as they have lower capital
and maintenance costs. It is simple to design high heat transfer rates and transfer areas.
There is a reduction in the occurrence of problems with fouling and corrosion, especially in
the pyrolysis environment.",1
337,"Activating unit is a fixed bed reactor (R-102) where the mixing of activating reagent
H3PO4 and water is entered at a 1:2 ratio with 85 wt% of acid. The reactor operates at atmo-
spheric conditions of 550 ◦C, which is ideal for harvesting feedstock. Complete conversion of
char was assumed. This could vary from 70 to 80%, depending on the reaction temperatures
and reagent ratio. The subsequent washing and extraction were conducted in V-106 and 107,
in which KOH and de-ionised water entered 3 times the AC flowrate with KOH at 10 wt%.
Drying (V-109) for the activated carbon is a crucial step due to the crystalline structure of the
AC. Fluidised bed dryers are suitable for granular and crystalline structures and ranges of
1–3 mm particle size. They are also suitable for continuous operation. Furthermore, they
are also appealing due to their short residence times and faster and uniform heat transfer;
however, these dryers’ power requirements will be higher [55]. The amount of air required
for the dryer was calculated based on humidity ratio and moisture content assumptions in
Appendix B. The final product flow of AC is 433 kg/hr.",1

392,"Bridgewater’s method uses a correlation of plant cost against the number of processing
steps and is suitable for plants that process liquids and solids [55]. The information required
for this method is the plant capacity in metric tonnes per year. The reactor conversion
(based on the mass of the desired product per mass fed into the reactor) and the number of
main unit operations (11) would have substantial costs, such as pressure vessels. Similarly,
the plant capacity is 3468 tonnes per year of AC, where the reactor conversion is estimated
to be 30–35% for biochar. Since the plant capacity for this project is less than 60,000 metric
tonnes per year and the plant location is in North England, so the equation has to account
for this instead of the US Gulf Coast on a 2003 basis [55] for the location factor. The location
factors are based on the International Construction Cost Factor Location Manual. The
factor for the US Gulf Coast is 1.00, and for the UK, it is 1.02. The cost escalation index
is from Chemical Engineering Journal—Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

472,"Proﬁts need to be determined. Hence, the cost of making the product without the
return on the equity capital investment needs to be known. The cash cost of production
is the sum of all the variable production costs. The proﬁt produced is subjected to UK
corporation tax set at 19%. To determine the cash ﬂow after tax has been taken, the net proﬁt
is calculated by subtracting the tax from the gross proﬁt. The amount of tax that would
need to be paid every year would vary; therefore, it might require to be inﬂated and would
need to be determined to get the best representation of after-tax cash ﬂow. The taxable
income is determined by subtracting the tax allowance from the gross proﬁt. The annual
depreciation allowance was calculated for the tax allowance. For the cash ﬂow diagram to
understand the net present value, ROI, and IRR, the interest rate was set at 11% and the
discounting factor set at 12%. The cash ﬂow initially ﬂows out of the company to pay for
the costs of engineering, equipment procurement, and plant construction (typically 3 years).
When the plant is constructed and begins operation, the revenues from the product’s sales
will be included. The cash ﬂow diagram for 20 years is given in Figure 2. From the cash
ﬂow diagram, various components were gathered, such as NPV, IRR, ROI, and PBP.",0

a potential project in terms of the cash ﬂow and the associated risks of the selected discount
rate. The method involves calculating the discounted net cash ﬂow. A positive NPV would
indicate the project is desirable and would gain a return. A negative NPV would show that
the project is not going forward as it would be worthless. The discount rate is essential,
mainly for the IRR, showing the minimum acceptable return. The discount rate and NPV
can be inversely proportional [55]. The NPV is calculated using Equation (4), where CFn is

491,"The sensitivity analysis usually accounts for the volatile parameters and examines the
effects of these uncertainties and their impact on the project’s viability. This would indicate
when the NPV would be most affected due to variations in parameters such as material
prices, as they can vary depending on the demand. More sophisticated analysis is necessary
to recognise the variables with the largest inﬂuences. The sensitivity analysis will evaluate
the discount rate’s effect on the NPV, and the increase in a discount rate decreased the net
present value. The NPV was done for 20 yrs. With a 12% discount rate and was calculated
at GBP 4,476,137,297.79. Therefore, this process is viable and can go ahead. The revenue
was changed based on a typical start-up schedule. Year one is the designing phase of the
project (starting point of the cash ﬂow), which is taken as 30% of ﬁxed capital. The second
year is construction, which is taken as 50% of ﬁxed capital. The third year is an ongoing
construction cost taken as 20% of ﬁxed capital and working capital, the full ﬁxed cost of
production (FCOP), and 30% of the variable cost of production (VCOP). The fourth year is
FCOP and 70% of VCOP. The ﬁfth year is FCOP + VCOP is 100% of design basis revenue.
FCOP + VCOP is the cash cost of production (CCOP). The revenue is then inﬂated for each
year. The cash ﬂow diagram was constructed by accounting for tax allowance and discount
ﬂow. The ﬁnancial summary indicated IRR and ROI to be 55 and 52%, respectively. The
payback is 3 years. The NPV proﬁle against varying discount rates for sensitivity analysis

495,"The deployment and supply of biochar feedstock in UK need to be evaluated as
this requires a ‘breakeven selling point’ for biochar [61]. Currently, there is difﬁculty in
understanding the extent of feasibility, which will cause difﬁculties in determining these
uncertainties due to the lack of data from demonstration or commercial facilities. Shackley
et al. [61] demonstrated the costs and beneﬁts associated with pyrolysis-biochar systems in
which the total cost of producing, delivering, and applying biochar is considered for the
UK and total beneﬁts (selling value of biochar). The main factors in the cost of the biochar

Transportation and storage—equipment, labour, and new covered storage facilities;
Energy production—electricity value and heat energy value;
Proﬁt of the biochar process include:
Process beneﬁts and reﬁnement;
Carbon abatement;
Pollution abatement.
Since there are limited data on large-scale MAP-biochar systems, there will be a
degree of uncertainty. However, experimental work will be relied upon to recommend
unit operations. In the context of techno-economic feasibility MAP system can only be
economically viable if it has a sustainable feedstock supply (PW), scalable technology (from
lab to pilot), and the capability for continuous operation for the long term (20-year plant
life). In terms of optimisation, the process should aim to have a lower pyrolysis temperature
with a shorter residence time without affecting the yield of char and AC.",0
497,4. Conclusions,0
498,"The study concludes with AC production currently viable based on these baseline
productions. However, the bio-oil (unreﬁned) price is relatively high and might not be
practical. The study aimed to perform an economic analysis to identify the viability of
producing activated carbon from pea waste. The total investment required for the project is
GBP 100,953,124.99. The plant cost can be recovered from year 3 (mid) for the 20-year life.
The NPV calculated is GBP 4,476,137,297.79 for 2020, and the associated IRR for the project
is 55%. The ROI in 2020 is 52%.",0
499,"The study concludes that bio-oil production is not viable based on baseline productions.
However, with detailed process economic calculations taken into account, a much better
judgement can be made. The fault can lie with bio-oil price, with the sale price having to be
substantially larger per quantity to generate a positive profit. Additional alternative scenarios
need to be examined, with the highest sensitivity identified, to assess bio-oil production’s
overall viability from PW accurately, explain the bio-oil quality, and improve profitability.",0

502,"To further assess the appropriateness of this production method for commercial AC,
environmental issues should be considered when designing the process and the unit
operations, along with their associated mitigating methods. This would affect the plant
costing estimation. Similarly, process control piping and instrumentation and start-up and
shut-down equipment need to be considered. A simulation package such as Aspen HYSYS
to simulate the whole process and include a detailed sizing of the equipment should be
used. This would allow for a better understanding of the purchase cost and installation
of the process equipment appropriate for the process. This would also better inform the
carbon dioxide emissions of the process for a better understanding of its ‘sustainability.",0
