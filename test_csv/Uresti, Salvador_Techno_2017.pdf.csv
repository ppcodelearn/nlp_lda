8,"Abstract: The availability and low cost of shale gas has boosted its use as fuel and as a raw material
to produce value-added compounds. Benzene is one of the chemicals that can be obtained from
methane, and represents one of the most important compounds in the petrochemical industry. It can
be synthesized via direct methane aromatization (DMA) or via indirect aromatization (using oxidative
coupling of methane). DMA is a direct-conversion process, while indirect aromatization involves
several stages. In this work, an economic, energy-saving, and environmental assessment for the
production of benzene from shale gas using DMA as a reaction path is presented. A sensitivity analysis
was conducted to observe the effect of the operating conditions on the proﬁtability of the process.
The results show that production of benzene using shale gas as feedstock can be accomplished with a
high return on investment.",0

10,1. Introduction,0
11,"The recent discoveries of large unconventional shale gas reserves have sparked a signiﬁcant
interest in their use as an energy source. Although methane is the main shale gas component, heavier
hydrocarbons such as C2, C3, and some inorganic gases (N2 and CO2) are also present in shale gas
reserves [1]. Because of the low permeability of rocks, shale gas extraction is more complicated than
that for natural gas. Nonetheless, an extraction technique that combines horizontal drilling with
hydraulic fracturing has been developed to provide shale gas for industrial processing [2]. The Energy
Information Administration [3] has reported that 32% of natural gas reserves are found as shale gas,
and that in 2009 proven shale gas reserves in the US numbered 60 TCF, while in 2013 this number
increased to 160 TCF [4]. Additionally, the production of shale gas in the US has increased substantially
in recent years, from 1.3 TCF in 2007 to nearly 15.2 TCF in 2015 [5]. The availability of shale gas has
not only led to a reduction in the price of natural gas, but has also motivated research to explore its use
as a feedstock for the synthesis of value-added chemicals [6–9].",0
12,"Other transformations of shale gas into chemicals are open for analysis. One such case is the
synthesis of benzene, one of the most important compounds in the petrochemical industry. Among
other uses, benzene serves as a starting molecule for ethylbenzene, which is then used for the
production of polystyrene. The benzene global demand in 2015 for its use in the chemical industry
was 46 million tons. In particular, that year the US industry imported more than 1.8 million tons [10].
Traditionally, benzene has mainly been produced from two processes based on catalytic reforming and
steam cracking.",0

17,"In this work, a design and analysis of a process to convert shale gas into benzene is presented.
The process is based on the direct methane aromatization route. The base economic results are
complemented with an analysis on potential heat integration and an environmental assessment in
terms of CO2 emissions.",0
18,2. The Direct Methane Aromatization (DMA) Process,0
19,"The direct aromatization of methane represents an attractive route for obtaining benzene from
shale gas. Although this reaction has thermodynamic limitations, its high selectivity towards benzene
makes it suitable for consideration [11]. Early reports on this option, however, were not totally
promising. Wang et al. [12] reported that methane can be used over a Mo/HZSM-5-based catalyst to
produce benzene as part of a complex reaction with a high selectivity (100%) but a low conversion
level (7.2%). Efforts to improve the yield of benzene using other metals such as Ru, W, and V did
not provide signiﬁcant improvement [13–16]. One of the main problems to overcome has been the
formation of carbonaceous products, favored at the high operating conditions required for the reaction,
which causes catalyst deactivation issues [17,18]. Efforts to synthesize more resistant catalysts for coke
formation have been reported [19–21], as well as operating strategies such as the addition of CO and
CO2 to the reactor feed to improve the lifetime of the catalyst [22–24]. Because of the unavoidable
coke formation, a continuous catalyst replacement is necessary in order to carry out a continuous
operation [25]. Some reactor designs have been explored in order to reduce the catalyst deactivation
effects [26–29]. Xu et al. [25,30] proposed the use of a reactor with three mobile beds; two of those are
used as catalyst regenerators and the third is used as the methane producer. Within this operation,
a complete regeneration of the catalyst can be achieved.",0
20,"Different byproducts can be obtained from benzene processes, depending on catalyst used and
the operating conditions. Ethylene can be formed as an intermediate compound in the methane
aromatization process, and has also been detected as a source of coke formation [15–18]. In other cases,
naphthalene and toluene can be obtained as byproducts [30–32]. In particular, for the DMA process
Xu et al. [30] reported selectivities of 62% and 17% for benzene and naphthalene, respectively, with
23% of methane conversion at 800 ◦C and 101.3 KPa. Chen et al. [33] reported conditions under which
ethylene and propylene can be produced from natural gas.",0
21,"Recent reports show the interest in improving catalyst performance and testing different reactor
arrangements to improve the performance of the DMA process. The Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was tested
in the form of zeolite capsules, and was shown to offer several advantages as compared to the solid
catalyst, such as an improved methane conversion, catalyst stability, rate of benzene formation, and
coke formation [34]. A test on the catalyst formulation showed that a reduction of Mo below 2% at
temperatures between 550 and 700 ◦C can provide signiﬁcant improvement in the oxidative stability
of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst [35]. To prevent coke formation, an operation mode based on periodic
oxygen pulsing added to the methane feed resulted in the production of synthesis gas as the main
sideproduct of the coke combustion, along with an improved bezene yield [36]. The combination
with membrane reactors has also been explored. An oxygen-transporting membrane was coupled to
an MDA reactor to improve its performance due to a better oxygen distribution into the reactor [37],
and the integration of an electrochemical BaZrO3-based membrane into an MDA reactor also resulted
in improved aromatics yields, as well as better catalyst stability [38].",0
22,3. Process Description and Results,1
23,"The process ﬂowsheet developed in this work to produce benzene from shale gas is based on the
methane dehydroaromatization reaction path. The best operating conditions reported in the literature
are considered. In the ﬂowsheet, a fresh stream of methane is fed into the process, mixed with a
methane-rich recycle stream; the mixture is heated to 800 ◦C and sent to the DMA reactor, which
operates at 800 ◦C and 1 atm [30]. The product of the reaction is sent to a membrane separation
system to remove the hydrogen produced [39]. The remaining gases are cooled and compressed before",1

26,"being sent to a ﬂash separator to recover the unreacted methane as a top product. Part of this stream
is purged, and the rest is returned to the reactor. The liquid obtained in the ﬂash unit is sent to a
distillation column, which puriﬁes the benzene product, with naphthalene obtained at the bottom of
the column as a byproduct. The process ﬂowsheet is shown in Figure 1.",1
27,Figure 1. Flowsheet for the direct methane aromatization-based benzene process.,1
28,"The Aspen Plus process simulator was used for the technical analysis of the ﬂowsheet. For the
MDA reactor, the use of the Mo/HZSM-5 catalyst was assumed. Although no kinetic model was found
for this reaction, the overall catalyst performance for benzene selectivity and methane conversion
reported by Xu et al. [30] provided the basis for modeling the unit as an RStoich reactor. The catalyst
performance includes the effect of a regeneration cycle using H2, which also limits the amount of
CO and CO2 produced with respect to an oxidative option. The membrane unit was modeled as a
separation module using the data reported by De vos [39]. As for coke, it was simulated as carbon [11,17].
Distillation columns were simulated using the Radfrac module, with 36 stages, condenser and
reboiler temperatures of 160 ◦C and 305 ◦C, a pressure condenser of 10 atm, and a pressure drop of
0.1 atm/stage.",0
29,"The initial results, based on a feed ﬂowrate of 1000 kmol/h of puriﬁed shale gas, are reported in
Table 1. The temperature and pressure conditions for each stream of the ﬂowsheet are included.
It can be observed that the benzene product is obtained with a purity of 97%, and that the
formation of hydrogen and naphthalene byproducts amounts to 1564 and 16.5 kmol/h, respectively.
The recirculation stream to the reactor contains 99% of methane.",1
30,"Two major variables that affect the performance of the process are the operating conditions of the
reactor and the ﬂash separation unit. A sensitivity analysis was then carried out in order to assess the
effect of such variables in the ﬂowsheet and detect the best operating conditions. The initial expectation
for the reactor is that that higher temperatures favor the reaction conversion, while lower pressures
promote the reaction towards the benzene product. For the ﬂash unit, the use of lower temperatures
and higher pressures favors the recovery of benzene. We proceeded to analyze the effect of temperature
and pressure of these units on the technical and economic performance of the process.",0

85,"For the estimation of the process investment, the report by DuBose [41] for a gas-to aromatics
process was taken as a basis. For a process with a capacity of 50,000 barrels of liquid product, which
includes a stage of catalyst regeneration, the investment was reported as 1.82 billion dollars. Using the
6/10 rule, we adjusted this value for our base benzene production of 100 kmol/h as 231.7 $MM.",0
86,"The price of benzene was set at $1025/T. Prices for naphthalene and hydrogen obtained as
byproducts were taken as $552/T and $2/kg, respectively. The purchase price of puriﬁed shale gas

as $4/MMBTU, $1.94/MMBTU, and $0.05/KWh [6,40].",0

conditions. The effect of the two limits on the reactor temperature and of the operating pressure
is reported. The highest ROI value of 27% was obtained when the operating conditions for the reactor

As far as the ﬂash unit, the best operating conditions were 20 ◦C and 10 bar. It was expected that,

benzene would beneﬁt the process proﬁtability, but the operating and ﬁxed costs adversely affected

of the process, and their heat duties can be reduced by energy integration. The stream data given in
Table 2 was used for the analysis; heat duties associated with the operation of distillation units were
not included. A pinch analysis was ﬁrst developed to obtain targets for heat integration. Based on a
minimum driving force of 10 K, the grand composite curve shown in Figure 4 was obtained. The target
values for energy integration show that the heating and cooling utilities could be reduced to 31.08 and
11.73 MW, which amount to reductions of 53.7 and 75.3%, respectively, as shown in Figure 5. Under
