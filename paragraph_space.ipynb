      "Abstract: Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is a highly valuable product in the chemical industry. It is\n",
      "widely used as an extracting agent for heavy metals, antibiotics, and lubricating oils. Generally, MIBK\n",
      "can be produced by three-step and one-step liquid-phase methods. These methods are expensive\n",
      "and energy-demanding due to the high pressure and low conversion of acetone. A novel nano-\n",
      "Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4 catalyst was developed to produce MIBK with high conversion and selectivity\n",
      "of 77.3% and 72.1%, respectively, at 350 ◦C and ambient pressure, eliminating the need for high\n",
      "pressure in conventional MIBK processes. This study is the ﬁrst that proposes a newly developed\n",
      "process of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) production using the low-pressure one-step gas-phase\n",
      "selective hydrogenation of acetone. In this work, a novel process ﬂow diagram has been developed\n",
      "for the production of MIBK using the developed nano-catalyst. The process was heat integrated,\n",
      "resulting in a 26% and a 19.5% reduction in the heating and cooling utilities, respectively, leading to\n",
      "a 12.6% reduction in the total energy demand. An economic analysis was performed to determine\n",
      "the economic feasibility of the developed process, which shows that the process is highly proﬁtable,\n",
      "in which it reduced both the capital and operating costs of MIBK synthesis and showed a return on\n",
      "investment (ROI) of 29.6% with a payback period of 2.2 years. It was found that the ROI could be\n",
      "increased by 18% when the reactor temperature is increased to 350 ◦C. In addition, the economic\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is an industrially important chemical worldwide. It can\n",
      "be used in a wide variety of important applications, including protective surface coating,\n",
      "vinyl, and acrylic resins, the extraction of metallic salts, and the removal of parafﬁn from\n",
      "mineral oils [1–5]. It is also used in the production of paints and rubber, as well as a solvent\n",
      "in a variety of pharmaceuticals and adhesives [6,7].\n",
      "The global production of MIBK was 430,000 metric tons in 2020 [8]. The market\n",
      "for MIBK is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than\n",
      "6% by 2026. This is due to the increasing demand for MIBK, especially in the synthesis\n",
      "of antioxidant additives for rubber, and the growing demand for solvents in chemical\n",
      "processes [9].\n",
      "In addition to MIBK, a crucial byproduct is also produced, which is isopropyl alcohol\n",
      "(IPA). It has tremendous industrial, medical, and hygienic applications, including alcohol\n",
      "wipes, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and swabs, which increases the prospects of applying\n",
      "the MIBK process with minimal waste. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\n",

      "contain between 60% and 90% of alcohol, and the use of 70% of IPA is recommended [10].\n",
      "Medical IPA was scientiﬁcally proven as a disinfectant that inactivates viruses such as the\n",

      "MIBK can be produced by several processes, but essentially by a three-step [11] method\n",
      "and a single-step method [12–17]. Each of these processes can be carried out with different\n",
      "catalysts, raw materials, and reaction conditions [12]. The three-step method involves aldol\n",
      "condensation of acetone over homogeneous aqueous-based catalysts, such as sodium and\n",
      "calcium hydroxide, forming diacetone alcohol (DAA), which is subsequently dehydrated\n",
      "to mesityl oxide (MO). The ﬁnal step is the selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond of MO\n",
      "to MIBK using Cu or Ni catalysts [18,19]. The most commonly occurring side reactions are\n",
      "over-condensation and unselective hydrogenation [20].\n",
      "The three-step process produces a considerable amount of wastewater containing\n",
      "acidic impurities due to the homogeneous catalyst, which creates a corrosive environment\n",
      "associated with high capital and operating costs for the neutralization process, acetone\n",
      "condensation, and product puriﬁcation [18,19,21]. Alternatively, the one-step process\n",
      "using a metal-supported catalyst was demonstrated to be more efﬁcient [22–28]. The\n",
      "support catalyzes acetone condensation to mesityl oxide (MO), an α,β-unsaturated ketone,\n",
      "followed by in situ catalytic reductions to MIBK using palladium on acidic ion-exchange\n",
      "resins [18,29,30], while there are other processes that use Pd/zirconium phosphate [31].\n",
      "In the one-step liquid-phase process, hydrogen and acetone are passed over metal base\n",
      "catalysts at moderate temperature and high pressure to produce MIBK in a single step,\n",
      "saving enormous costs that are required in the three-step method [32]. Under these reaction\n",
      "conditions, aldol condensation and dehydration are reversible [33], but the catalyst shifts\n",
      "the equilibrium toward MO, irreversibly hydrogenating it toward MIBK [28].\n",
      "Despite the many advantages offered by the liquid-phase one-step process, it suffers\n",
      "from high pressure, ranging from 3 to 10 MPa [13], which signiﬁcantly increases the capital\n",
      "and operating costs. This is in addition to the large recycle ﬂow rate due to the low\n",
      "conversion of acetone, which increases the size of equipment in the recycle loop as well as\n",
      "the additional energy that is needed for recovering the unreacted acetone in the distillation\n",
      "column. Therefore, it is an industrial objective to reduce the pressure and increase the\n",
      "conversion and selectivity to make the process more proﬁtable.\n",
      "Recently, Qianling et al. reported a bifunctional catalyst TiO2/Al2O32 and Pd/Cor for\n",
      "one-pot liquid-phase synthesis of MIBK from acetone, which provides acetone conversion\n",
      "of (35–45)% with a selectivity of (80–90)% to MIBK at 150 ◦C and 2.0 MPa [34]. However, the\n",
      "process still suffers from the high-pressure requirement with moderate acetone conversion.\n",

      "and dehydration to provide an acetone conversion of 58.24% and selectivity of 68.39%\n",
      "to MIBK [35]. In addition, various kinds of support, including metal oxides [19,36,37]\n",

      "Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is an industrially important chemical worldwide. It can\n",
      "be used in a wide variety of important applications, including protective surface coating,\n",
      "vinyl, and acrylic resins, the extraction of metallic salts, and the removal of parafﬁn from\n",
      "mineral oils [1–5]. It is also used in the production of paints and rubber, as well as a solvent\n",
      "in a variety of pharmaceuticals and adhesives [6,7].\n",
      "The global production of MIBK was 430,000 metric tons in 2020 [8]. The market\n",
      "for MIBK is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than\n",
      "6% by 2026. This is due to the increasing demand for MIBK, especially in the synthesis\n",
      "of antioxidant additives for rubber, and the growing demand for solvents in chemical\n",
      "processes [9].\n",
      "In addition to MIBK, a crucial byproduct is also produced, which is isopropyl alcohol\n",
      "(IPA). It has tremendous industrial, medical, and hygienic applications, including alcohol\n",
      "wipes, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and swabs, which increases the prospects of applying\n",

      "Prevention (CDC) in the United States, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and cleansing wipes\n",
      "contain between 60% and 90% of alcohol, and the use of 70% of IPA is recommended [10].\n",
      "Medical IPA was scientiﬁcally proven as a disinfectant that inactivates viruses such as the\n",

      "MIBK can be produced by several processes, but essentially by a three-step [11] method\n",
      "and a single-step method [12–17]. Each of these processes can be carried out with different\n",
      "catalysts, raw materials, and reaction conditions [12]. The three-step method involves aldol\n",
      "condensation of acetone over homogeneous aqueous-based catalysts, such as sodium and\n",
      "calcium hydroxide, forming diacetone alcohol (DAA), which is subsequently dehydrated\n",
      "to mesityl oxide (MO). The ﬁnal step is the selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond of MO\n",
      "to MIBK using Cu or Ni catalysts [18,19]. The most commonly occurring side reactions are\n",
      "over-condensation and unselective hydrogenation [20].\n",
      "The three-step process produces a considerable amount of wastewater containing\n",
      "acidic impurities due to the homogeneous catalyst, which creates a corrosive environment\n",
      "associated with high capital and operating costs for the neutralization process, acetone\n",
      "condensation, and product puriﬁcation [18,19,21]. Alternatively, the one-step process\n",
      "using a metal-supported catalyst was demonstrated to be more efﬁcient [22–28]. The\n",
      "support catalyzes acetone condensation to mesityl oxide (MO), an α,β-unsaturated ketone,\n",
      "followed by in situ catalytic reductions to MIBK using palladium on acidic ion-exchange\n",
      "resins [18,29,30], while there are other processes that use Pd/zirconium phosphate [31].\n",
      "In the one-step liquid-phase process, hydrogen and acetone are passed over metal base\n",
      "catalysts at moderate temperature and high pressure to produce MIBK in a single step,\n",
      "saving enormous costs that are required in the three-step method [32]. Under these reaction\n",
      "conditions, aldol condensation and dehydration are reversible [33], but the catalyst shifts\n",
      "the equilibrium toward MO, irreversibly hydrogenating it toward MIBK [28].\n",
      "Despite the many advantages offered by the liquid-phase one-step process, it suffers\n",
      "from high pressure, ranging from 3 to 10 MPa [13], which signiﬁcantly increases the capital\n",
      "and operating costs. This is in addition to the large recycle ﬂow rate due to the low\n",
      "conversion of acetone, which increases the size of equipment in the recycle loop as well as\n",
      "the additional energy that is needed for recovering the unreacted acetone in the distillation\n",
      "column. Therefore, it is an industrial objective to reduce the pressure and increase the\n",
      "conversion and selectivity to make the process more proﬁtable.\n",
      "Recently, Qianling et al. reported a bifunctional catalyst TiO2/Al2O32 and Pd/Cor for\n",
      "one-pot liquid-phase synthesis of MIBK from acetone, which provides acetone conversion\n",
      "of (35–45)% with a selectivity of (80–90)% to MIBK at 150 ◦C and 2.0 MPa [34]. However, the\n",
      "process still suffers from the high-pressure requirement with moderate acetone conversion.\n",
      "Baining et al. proposed an alternative support with high thermal stability and adjustable\n",
      "acid-base property using phosphor-doped h-BN that catalyzes the aldol condensation\n",
      "and dehydration to provide an acetone conversion of 58.24% and selectivity of 68.39%\n",
      "to MIBK [35]. In addition, various kinds of support, including metal oxides [19,36,37]\n",
      "and sulfonated graphene [38,39], have also been a prime focus in the development of the\n",
      "process.\n",

      "perturbations, raw material costs, product costs, utility costs, and ﬁxed capital costs were\n",
      "varied by ±15% of their current prices. Figure 7 shows the overall sensitivity analysis\n",
      "of the above factors at a constant production rate and 10 years of operation. It shows\n",
      "that the process is highly dependent on the product prices, in which a 10% increase could\n",

      "Abstract: Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is a highly valuable product in the chemical industry. It is\n",
      "widely used as an extracting agent for heavy metals, antibiotics, and lubricating oils. Generally, MIBK\n",
      "can be produced by three-step and one-step liquid-phase methods. These methods are expensive\n",
      "and energy-demanding due to the high pressure and low conversion of acetone. A novel nano-\n",
      "Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4 catalyst was developed to produce MIBK with high conversion and selectivity\n",
      "of 77.3% and 72.1%, respectively, at 350 *C and ambient pressure, eliminating the need for high\n",
      "pressure in conventional MIBK processes. This study is the first that proposes a newly developed\n",
      "process of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) production using the low-pressure one-step gas-phase\n",
      "selective hydrogenation of acetone. In this work, a novel process flow diagram has been developed\n",
      "for the production of MIBK using the developed nano-catalyst. The process was heat integrated,\n",
      "resulting in a 26% and a 19.5% reduction in the heating and cooling utilities, respectively, leading to\n",
      "a 12.6% reduction in the total energy demand. An economic analysis was performed to determine\n",
      "the economic feasibility of the developed process, which shows that the process is highly profitable,\n",
      "in which it reduced both the capital and operating costs of MIBK synthesis and showed a return on\n",
      "investment (ROI) of 29.6% with a payback period of 2.2 years. It was found that the ROI could be\n",
      "increased by 18% when the reactor temperature is increased to 350 *C. In addition, the economic\n",
      "sensitivity analysis showed that the process is highly sensitive to product prices and least sensitive to\n",
      "utility prices, which is due to the versatility of the process that requires only a low amount of energy.\n",

      "Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) is an industrially important chemical worldwide. It can\n",
      "be used in a wide variety of important applications, including protective surface coating,\n",
      "vinyl, and acrylic resins, the extraction of metallic salts, and the removal of paraffin from\n",
      "mineral oils [1-5]. It is also used in the production of paints and rubber, as well as a solvent\n",
      "in a variety of pharmaceuticals and adhesives [6,7].\n",
      "The global production of MIBK was 430,000 metric tons in 2020 [8]. The market\n",
      "for MIBK is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than\n",
      "6% by 2026. This is due to the increasing demand for MIBK, especially in the synthesis\n",
      "of antioxidant additives for rubber, and the growing demand for solvents in chemical\n",
      "processes [9].\n",
      "In addition to MIBK, a crucial byproduct is also produced, which is isopropyl alcohol\n",
      "(IPA). It has tremendous industrial, medical, and hygienic applications, including alcohol\n",
      "wipes, hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and swabs, which increases the prospects of applying\n",
      "the MIBK process with minimal waste. According to the Centers for Disease Control and\n",

      "Prevention (CDC) in the United States, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and cleansing wipes\n",
      "contain between 60% and 90% of alcohol, and the use of 70% of IPA is recommended [10].\n",
      "Medical IPA was scientifically proven as a disinfectant that inactivates viruses such as the\n",
      "COVID-19 virus.\n",
      "MIBK can be produced by several processes, but essentially by a three-step [11] method\n",
      "and a single-step method [12-17]. Each of these processes can be carried out with different\n",
      "catalysts, raw materials, and reaction conditions [12]. The three-step method involves aldol\n",
      "condensation of acetone over homogeneous aqueous-based catalysts, such as sodium and\n",
      "calcium hydroxide, forming diacetone alcohol (DAA), which is subsequently dehydrated\n",
      "to mesityl oxide (MO). The final step is the selective hydrogenation of the C=C bond of MO\n",
      "to MIBK using Cu or Ni catalysts [18,19]. The most commonly occurring side reactions are\n",
      "over-condensation and unselective hydrogenation [20].\n",
      "The three-step process produces a considerable amount of wastewater containing\n",
      "acidic impurities due to the homogeneous catalyst, which creates a corrosive environment\n",
      "associated with high capital and operating costs for the neutralization process, acetone\n",
      "condensation, and product purification [18,19,21]. Alternatively, the one-step process\n",
      "using a metal-supported catalyst was demonstrated to be more efficient [22-28]. The\n",
      "support catalyzes acetone condensation to mesityl oxide (MO), an a,b-unsaturated ketone,\n",
      "followed by in situ catalytic reductions to MIBK using palladium on acidic ion-exchange\n",
      "resins [18,29,30], while there are other processes that use Pd/zirconium phosphate [31].\n",
      "In the one-step liquid-phase process, hydrogen and acetone are passed over metal base\n",
      "catalysts at moderate temperature and high pressure to produce MIBK in a single step,\n",
      "saving enormous costs that are required in the three-step method [32]. Under these reaction\n",
      "conditions, aldol condensation and dehydration are reversible [33], but the catalyst shifts\n",
      "the equilibrium toward MO, irreversibly hydrogenating it toward MIBK [28].\n",
      "Despite the many advantages offered by the liquid-phase one-step process, it suffers\n",
      "from high pressure, ranging from 3 to 10 MPa [13], which significantly increases the capital\n",
      "and operating costs. This is in addition to the large recycle flow rate due to the low\n",
      "conversion of acetone, which increases the size of equipment in the recycle loop as well as\n",
      "the additional energy that is needed for recovering the unreacted acetone in the distillation\n",
      "column. Therefore, it is an industrial objective to reduce the pressure and increase the\n",
      "conversion and selectivity to make the process more profitable.\n",
      "Recently, Qianling et al. reported a bifunctional catalyst TiO2/Al2O32 and Pd/Cor for\n",
      "one-pot liquid-phase synthesis of MIBK from acetone, which provides acetone conversion\n",
      "of (35-45)% with a selectivity of (80-90)% to MIBK at 150 *C and 2.0 MPa [34]. However, the\n",
      "process still suffers from the high-pressure requirement with moderate acetone conversion.\n",
      "Baining et al. proposed an alternative support with high thermal stability and adjustable\n",
      "acid-base property using phosphor-doped h-BN that catalyzes the aldol condensation\n",
      "and dehydration to provide an acetone conversion of 58.24% and selectivity of 68.39%\n",
      "to MIBK [35]. In addition, various kinds of support, including metal oxides [19,36,37]\n",
      "and sulfonated graphene [38,39], have also been a prime focus in the development of the\n",
      "process.\n",
      "In this context, a novel nanocrystalline zinc chromite-supported nanopalladium (nano-\n",
      "Pd/nano-ZnCr2O4) catalyst was developed by Bagabas et al. and Al-Rabiah et al. [20,40,41],\n",
      "which enables the production of MIBK in a one-step gas-phase reaction at atmospheric\n",
      "pressure. This can overcome the infirmities that the conventional process suffers from.\n",
      "However, the process requires a temperature of (200-350) *C, which is higher than the\n",
      "conventional process, which uses a temperature of (120-160) *C [15].\n",
      "The reaction involves base-acid coupling of acetone to form mesityl oxide (MO),\n",

      "Heat integration is an essential part of the process development. The reduction\n",
      "in energy usage not only reduces the operating costs but also prevents harmful carbon\n",
      "emissions in the environment. The required heating and cooling utilities were identified\n",
      "for the process as shown in Figure 1. Each process stream was drawn with a tail and a\n",
      "head representing the supplied temperature and the target temperature, respectively. The\n",
      "final heat exchanger network is shown in Figure 2, where the red and blue lines denote the\n",
      "hot and cold streams, respectively. The constructed network utilizes the energy content\n",
      "and high temperature of the reactor effluent to heat up the feed streams. The acetone feed\n",
      "(stream 2) leaving mixer M-101 will first be heated by the reactor effluent from 74.3 *C to\n",
      "242 *C, in which no further heating can occur due to the process constraint prohibiting\n",

      "by the hydrogen feed (stream 5) until it reaches a minimum temperature approach of\n",
      "10 *C to avoid an excessive large area. The outcome of the heat integration, as shown in\n",
      "Figure 3, is a reduction in the heating and cooling utilities by 26% and 19.5%, respectively.\n",
      "The reduction in the total utility demand is about 12.6%. In terms of economics, the\n",
      "implemented heat integration has resulted in an increase in the annualized capital cost\n",
      "by $12,134/year (for 10 years of operation). However, operating costs have decreased by\n",

      "varied by +-15% of their current prices. Figure 7 shows the overall sensitivity analysis\n",
      "of the above factors at a constant production rate and 10 years of operation. It shows\n",
      "that the process is highly dependent on the product prices, in which a 10% increase could\n",
